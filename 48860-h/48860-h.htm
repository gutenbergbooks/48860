<h2>THE BROWN OWL</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="111" height="105" alt="O" />
</div>
<p class='drop-cap'>ONCE upon a time, a long
while ago—in fact long
before Egypt had risen to
power and before Rome or Greece
had ever been heard of—and that was
some time before you were born, you
know—there was a king who reigned
over a very large and powerful kingdom.</p>

<p>Now this king was rather old, he
had founded his kingdom himself, and
he had reigned over it nine hundred
and ninety-nine and a half years
already. As I have said before, it was
a very large kingdom, for it contained,
among other things, the whole of the
western half of the world. The rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the world was divided into smaller
kingdoms, and each kingdom was ruled
over by separate princes, who, however,
were none of them so old as Intafernes,
as he was called.</p>

<p>Now King Intafernes was an exceedingly
powerful magician—that
was why he had remained so long
on the throne; for you must know that
in this country the people were divided
into two classes—those who were magicians,
and those who weren’t. The
magicians called themselves Aristocrats,
and the others called themselves what
they liked; also in this country, as in
all other countries, the rich magicians
had the upper hand over the rest, but
still the others did not grumble, for
they were not badly treated on the
whole. Now of all the magicians in
the country the King was the greatest,
and no one approached him in magic
power but the Chancellor, who was
called Merrymineral, and he even was
no match for the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Among other things King Intafernes
had a daughter, who was exceedingly
beautiful—as indeed all princesses
are or ought to be. She had a
very fair face, and a wealth of golden
hair that fell over her shoulders, like a
shining waterfall falling in ripples to
her waist.</p>

<p>Now in the thousandth year of her
father’s reign the Princess was eighteen,
and in that country she was already of
age. Three days before her nineteenth
birthday, however, her father fell sick
and gradually weakened, until at last
he had only strength left to lie in his
royal bed. Still, however, he retained
his faculties, and on the Princess’s
birthday he made all the magicians
file before his bed and swear to be
faithful for ever to the Princess. Last
of all came the Chancellor, the pious
Merrymineral, and as he took the oath
the King looked at him with a loving
glance and said:</p>

<p>‘Ah! my dear Merrymineral, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
truth there was no need for thee to
have taken the oath, for it is thy
nature to be faithful; and it being thy
nature, thou couldst not but be faithful.’</p>

<p>To which the pious Merrymineral
answered:</p>

<p>‘To such a master and to such a
mistress how could I but be faithful?’
and to this noble sentiment the three
hundred and forty-seven magicians
could not help according unanimous
applause.</p>

<p>When they were quiet again the
King said:</p>

<p>‘So be it, good Merrymineral, do thou
always act up to thy words. But now
leave, good men all, for I am near my
end, and would fain spend my last
moments with my daughter here.’</p>

<p>Sorrowfully, one by one, the courtiers
left, wishing him their last adieux.
He had been a good king to all, all
through his long reign, and they were
sorry that he had to leave them at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon they were all gone except the
good Merrymineral, and at last he too
went, his whole frame shaking with
suppressed sobs; his body seemed
powerless with grief, and his limbs
seemed to refuse their functions. The
King looked after him, carefully noticing
whether the door was shut. Then he
spoke:</p>

<p>‘My dear daughter,’ he said, ‘when
I am gone be kind to every one, and,
above all, cherish the Owl—do cherish
the Owl—promise me to cherish the
Owl.’</p>

<p>‘But how can I cherish the Owl?’
cried the poor Princess; ‘how can I,
unless I know who he is?’</p>

<p>But the King only answered:</p>

<p>‘Dear Ismara, do promise to cherish
the Owl!’</p>

<p>And he said nothing else for a long
time, until at last the Princess saw that
the only way to let him rest in peace
was to promise, and she said:</p>

<p>‘I promise, dear father, but still I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
do wish I knew who or what the Owl
is that I am to cherish.’</p>

<p>‘You will see that in good time,’
answered the King. ‘Now, my dear
Ismara, I shall die happy, and you
will be safe. If you had not promised—however,
we will let that rest
unsaid. Now wheel the bed to where
I can see out of the window.’</p>

<p>The Princess did as she was told.
Now from this you must not imagine
that she was a very strong princess—for
she was no stronger than most
princesses of her age; but the old
King, who was a very powerful magician,
as I have told you already, made
the bed easy for her to move. He
might have made it move of its own
accord, but he knew that it would
please his daughter to be of service to
him, and so he let her move it.</p>

<p>The view from the window was very
fine. A dark wood grew in the foreground,
and far away over the tree-tops
were the blue hills, behind which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sun was just preparing to retire. And
it seemed angry, the sun, for its face
was dark and clouded, and its beams
smote fiercely on everything, and gilded
the tops of the autumn trees with a
purer gold than their natural tint.
But overhead the clouds spread darkly,
and they reached in a black pall to
the verge of the horizon, forming a black
frame to the red-gold sunset; for only
the extreme west was bright with the
waning light.</p>

<p>The Princess sat on the bed beside
the King, and the dying sun lit them
both and fell with a ruddy glare on
the King’s hard countenance, as if it
knew that his work on earth for the
day, and for ever, was done.</p>

<p>‘Is it not grand?’ cried the old
King, as if the glorious sight warmed
his blood again and made him once
more young. ‘And is it not grand to
think of the power that thou hast, my
daughter? If thou but raise thy little
finger armies will move from world’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
end to world’s end. Fleets come
daily from every land for thee alone;
all that thou seest is thine, and utterly
within thy power. Think of the power,
the grand power, of swaying the world.’</p>

<p>But long before he had got thus
far, the Princess was weeping bitterly—partly
at the overwhelming prospect,
and partly from her great grief. She
seized her father’s hand and kissed it
passionately.</p>

<p>‘My father, my father,’ she cried,
‘say not so; they are all thine, not mine,
for thou livest still, and all is yet well.’</p>

<p>But the old King cut her short:</p>

<p>‘Dost thou see the sun? Look,
its lower rim is already cut by the
mountains. When its disc is hidden
I too shall have joined the majority,
and my soul will have left my body,
and the power will be thine. But
above all cherish the Owl. Never go
out of its sight, for if thou do, some
harm will happen.’</p>

<p>As he stopped speaking a flash of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lightning lit up the sky, and the sullen
roar of distant thunder followed.</p>

<p>From every church in the land the
passing bell tolled forth and the solemn
sounds came swelling on the breeze.
Again came the flash of lightning, and
again the thunder, and now the splash
of falling rain accompanied and almost
drowned the thunder. The sun’s rim
was now almost down.</p>

<p>For the last time the old King kissed
his daughter, as she hung weeping on
his neck. Again the lightning came,
but this time the thunder was drowned
in a more fearful sound. Never before
had the sound been heard, except at
the death of the Princess’s mother.
It was the passing bell of the cathedral
of the town. And as its sound went
forth throughout the whole land men
shook their heads in sorrow, for they
knew that the soul of the good King
had left his body. Through the whole
land the news was known—to every
one except to the Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>For she lay on the bed passionately
kissing the dead face—not yet cold in
death—and calling on his name in
vain; for the ears of the dead are
closed ‘to the voice of the charmer,
charm he never so wisely.’</p>

<p>Gradually the voice of the Princess
died away into low sobs and her breathing
came more regularly, and in spite
of the tolling of the death-bell she
slept, worn out by her grief. No one
came near her, for at the Court no
one was allowed to enter the royal
presence without a command, whatever
happened. So for a time the
Princess slept on, clasping the still
face to her warm cheek. But at last
the death-cold of the face wakened
her once more to the death-cold of
the world. For a time her wakening
dreams refused to let her believe the
worst, but the stern reality forced
itself on her. She raised herself on
her two arms and gazed through the
darkness at the white face that made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
her shudder when her longing eyes
at last traced out its lines as a flash
of lightning lit it up. She sprang off
the bed with a wild impulse of calling
for help.</p>

<p>But no sooner had she got to the
door and had given the call than she
once more fainted and seemed for a
time lifeless.</p>

<p>When she came to herself again she
was in bed in her own room. It was
still night, and at the side of her bed
a night-light was burning in a glass
shade. She could not understand
what it all meant; but her head did
ache so, and she could not tell why
they were making such a noise at the
far end of the room. For you see she
was lying on her back low down in the
pillows, and so she could not see
beyond the foot of the bed. However,
she raised herself on her elbow
and looked. For a short time she
could see nothing, for the room was
somewhat dark, as the night-light gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
but little light But at the other end
of the room a large fire was burning,
and by its light the Princess saw a
strange scene.</p>

<p>For in the middle of the floor she
could make out a group of three ladies-in-waiting,
who were struggling with a
large black object—what it was the
Princess could not see, but it seemed
to be attempting to attack the Court
doctor, who was huddled up in a
corner with his umbrella spread out
before him, and he was gradually
sinking down behind it, giving vent
to the most horrible groans and
shrieks for mercy, and calling to the
ladies to keep it off. However, in
spite of their efforts, the ‘thing’ was
gradually drawing them nearer and
nearer to the poor doctor.</p>

<p>But the strangest thing of all was
that the doctor’s face was lit up by
two distinct rounds of light. It was
just as if some one had turned the
light of a bull’s-eye lantern on him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and this the Princess could not understand
at all. However, she lay still
and watched.</p>

<p>The doctor got farther and farther
behind the umbrella until only his
head appeared over the top of it. At
last he shrieked:</p>

<p>‘Send for a regiment of Lifeguards—let
them shoot the Owl—it is necessary
for the health of the Princess. Owls
are very bad things to have in bedrooms—they
bring scarlatina, and they
always carry the influenza epidemic.
Lifeguards, I tell you, send for them.’
But still the ‘thing’ came nearer, and
with an agonised shriek of ‘The Owl!’
he sank altogether under the rim.</p>

<p>This loud cry of ‘The Owl’ roused
the Princess, and she remembered her
promise to cherish the Owl. So she
called to the ladies-in-waiting, and they,
astonished, let go the thing, and the
Owl immediately flew at the umbrella,
underneath which the doctor was
coiled up, and perched on the top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The Princess, however, thought it was
rather rash to have promised to cherish
the Owl if it was going to eat up her
physicians in that reckless manner.
However, the Owl did not seem
aggressive, and only seemed as if it
were waiting for further orders. The
Princess determined to see if it would
come when it was called, like a dog.
So she called in a sweet, persuasive
voice:</p>

<p>‘Come here, good Owl.’</p>

<p>Immediately the dark shape of the
Owl flitted noiselessly to her side as
she sat on the bed. The wind of its
flight blew out the flickering night-light
in spite of the glass shade. But the
glittering eyes of the Owl lit up the
whole room, so that there was no need
of light. As it alighted on the bed it
turned its eyes on the Princess as
much as to say, ‘What shall I do
now?’</p>

<p>But the fierce light of the eyes was
softened as it turned to her, as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Owl feared to hurt her with the blinding
rays.</p>

<p>‘Cherished Owl,’ said the Princess,
‘why didst thou hurt the physician?’</p>

<p>The Owl shook his head; but the
Princess could not understand whether
he meant that he did not know why
he had hurt him, or if he meant he
had not hurt him. So the Princess
told one of the ladies-in-waiting to
remove the umbrella from over the
doctor. But this was not so easy as
it sounded, for the doctor held firmly
on to the handle, and in spite of the
united efforts of the three ladies-in-waiting
he managed to hold on. At
last the Princess lost patience.</p>

<p>‘Go and help them, good Owl,’ she
said; and the Owl, overjoyed, flew to
the doctor, and seizing the top of the
umbrella flew with it up to the ceiling,
and as the doctor still held on, he
flew round and round, until the doctor,
hitting the top of a cupboard, let go,
and fell in a heap in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the floor, where he lay half unconscious,
repeating as he sat:</p>

<p>‘Orange juice for influenza; try a
seidlitz powder and a blue pill, and
keep the owls out of the room and
take a warm bath, and—send for the
Lifeguards.’</p>

<p>But the Princess did not seem
inclined to send for them; and in
truth it would have been rather
awkward for the horses to get in, as
the room was on the second floor.</p>

<p>So the Princess told the ladies-in-waiting
to drag him out of the room,
and they obeyed; but as he went
he said: ‘Sleeping in unaired sheets
causes rheumatism, sciatica, pleurisy,
pneumonia and—owls;’ and as the
door closed they heard him say,
‘Gregory powder and Epsom salts.’</p>

<p>The poor Princess, however, began
to weep again, and the Owl sat
perched on the bed-post at her feet,
watching her with his bright eyes.</p>

<p>However, after she had cried thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
for a long time, she thought it would
be better to stop her tears, for they
were all in vain, as she knew but too
well.</p>

<p>So she rose from her bed; for you
must know she had only been laid on
her bed when she had fainted, and so
she still had all her clothes on.</p>

<p>Through the window-blinds the
light of dawn was already beginning to
show itself. So the Princess went to
the window and drew back the curtains,
and let the bright sunlight shine into
the room. A beautiful day was dawning
after the last night’s rain, and the
sun was rising brightly over the edge
of the blue sea. For a moment, as
she looked out, everything was quiet
except the shrill chirp of a solitary
sparrow that seemed to have awakened
too early. From the chimneys of the
red-roofed town below her no smoke
was rising, for all in the town were
asleep still.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a rush, the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
breeze came from over the land behind
her, and with the rustle of the wind
everything seemed to wake and come
to life once more. The solitary chirp
of the sparrow was drowned in the
flood of song that poured forth from
the trees in the palace garden, and
with the birds the rest of the living
animals awoke, and from far inland
the lowing of the cows was borne on
the breeze, and now and again came
the joyful bark of the shepherd’s dog
as it recognised its master’s whistle as
he called it to work again among the
sheep, whose plaintive bleating came
softly, as if from a distance, to the
Princess’s ear.</p>

<p>Everything seemed joyful at the
sight of the beautiful morning except
the Princess, and she felt oh so lonely,
for it seemed as if her only friend had
gone from her for ever. And at the
thought her tears began to flow afresh,
for she felt very lonely, while everything
else seemed to rejoice. But as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
she leant thus against the window-sill,
with a great lump in her throat and
the hot tears in her eyes, she suddenly
felt a weight on her shoulder and a
rushing wind waved her hair, and as
she turned her head to see what it
was, her face was covered in the soft
brown feathers of the Owl, who had
perched on her shoulder.</p>

<p>The touch of the Owl seemed to
have driven away her grief, and she
felt quite light and joyful in the
beautiful sunshine. For it seemed as
if the Owl had become a companion
to her that would take the place of
her father; so she leaned her head
against the Owl, and her golden hair
mixed with the dusky brown feathers,
till each streak of golden hair shone
again in the bright sunlight. And the
Owl too seemed very happy. So for a
time the Princess stood looking over
the deep-blue sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, a footstep
sounded in the courtyard below, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the Princess drew back from the
window, for a thought suddenly came
into her head:</p>

<p>‘Oh dear,’ she said, ‘I have been
crying such a lot that my eyes must
be quite red, and my hair is all ruffled.
This will never do.’ And as she
looked in the glass she said, ‘Ah, just
as I thought. Come, my cherished
Owl, sit there on the crown on the top
of the looking-glass frame and wait
while I wash my hands and face and
make myself tidy.’</p>

<p>The Owl did as he was told, and the
Princess began to wash in cold water—a
thing she had never done before—but
she did not like to call to her
ladies-in-waiting, lest they should see
how red her eyes were. So she had
to put up with the cold water, and very
pleasant she found it, for it cleared the
tear-mist out of her eyes and made
her feel quite happy and cheerful
again: ‘And I have heard,’ she
thought to herself, ‘that washing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
cold water is matchless for the complexion.’</p>

<p>When she had finished washing she
went and combed her hair before the
glass. For she was a very artistic
Princess, and liked looking at beautiful
things, and so she liked sometimes to
look at herself in the glass. Not that
she was in the least conceited.</p>

<p>So she combed her hair with a gold
comb, and when she had finished
combing it, she put on her gold circlet
as a sign of her rank, and then she
said to the Owl, who had been sitting
patiently on the looking-glass blinking
at her as if he quite enjoyed himself:</p>

<p>‘Now, cherished Owl, you may sit
on my shoulder again.’</p>

<p>When the Owl was again in his
place he blinked in the glass at his
own reflection as if the light were too
strong for him, and he shut his eyes
and drew in his neck and lifted up one
foot into his feathers, as if he felt quite
happy and comfortable, and the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
smiled at his happy look, for she
seemed quite to have forgotten her
sorrow in the company of the Owl.</p>

<p>So she, with the Owl on her shoulder,
went to the window. Here in the
courtyard already a large crowd had
collected to catch a glimpse of the
Princess if possible, so that it fell
about that when they saw her they
raised a mighty shout of joy and pity:</p>

<p>‘The King is dead,’ they cried.
‘Long live the Queen!’ And throughout
the city far and wide echoed and
re-echoed the cry:</p>

<p>‘Long live the Queen’; and it
seemed as if the waves of the sea
murmured the sound.</p>

<p>The Princess, however, held out her
little hand to still the tumult, and as if
by magic the cries stopped.</p>

<p>‘Good people all,’ she said in clear
ringing tones, ‘I thank you for your
good wishes, and I will try always to
be worthy of them as my father was.
For to-day, however, rejoice not;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
remember that the great King Intafernes,
the founder of the kingdom to
which we all belong, has but just left
the earth—sorrow for him but a short
time; joy will come soon enough for
all.’</p>

<p>So the crowd, silent and pensive for
a time, dispersed in groups. More
than one of them asked what had been
perched on the Princess’s shoulder,
and those who had been near enough,
said that it was an owl—though what
it meant they knew not.</p>

<p>‘To me it seemed as if the head of
the old King were looking over his
daughter’s shoulder,’ said one of the
listeners who stood on the outskirts of
the crowd.</p>

<p>But she was only a little hunchback,
and the rich citizens laughed at her,
saying: ‘Tush, child—thy fancy is not
sound! Or else before looking at the
Princess thou didst look at the fierce
sun, and the sun-spots in thy eyes
caused thee to see it thus. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but an owl.’ But the little hunchback
held to her own opinion.</p>

<p>But while the Princess stood watching
them depart, a tapping came at
the door, and the Princess cried ‘Come
in.’ A page entered and said that the
Chancellor, Merrymineral, was below
and requested audience of the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Let him be shown into the audience
chamber to await me there.’</p>

<p>The page bowed and departed on
his errand, and the Princess went to
another door in the room and down
the staircase that led from it to the
audience chamber, and the Owl remained
seated on her shoulder until
they reached the room. When they
got there the Chancellor had not yet
entered, for the staircase from the
Princess’s bedroom to the audience
chamber was much shorter than
that from the entrance hall, and then
you see the Princess was much more
nimble than Merrymineral, who was an
old man, and she ran quickly downstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
whilst he walked slowly up.
However at last he entered. As he
came in the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘Good morning, dear Merrymineral.
How is it you are so late? I shall
have to fine you if you keep me
waiting like this again. And now
what do you want with me?’</p>

<p>The good Chancellor received her
laughing reproach with his head bowed
down. He heaved a deep sigh, and
drew his pocket-handkerchief from his
pocket and applied it to his eyes. As
he drew it away the tears could be
seen flowing fast down his withered
cheeks.</p>

<p>‘I came,’ he moaned, ‘to console
you for your great loss. I too,’ he
continued in a voice choked with sobs,
‘I too am an orphan.’</p>

<p>It seemed funny to the Princess to
see him weeping thus, and she could
hardly help laughing at him, but her
grief soon came back.</p>

<p>‘Poor Merrymineral,’ she sighed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
‘to you also it must be a sad blow,
for you were always faithful and
attached. But it was fated to happen
thus, and you must really try and be
comforted, for crying will not mend
matters.’</p>

<p>The Chancellor began again:</p>

<p>‘The beloved King your father’; but
his sobs choked him, and he hid his
face.</p>

<p>‘The beloved King your father,’
echoed a loud voice, exactly mimicking
the tones of the Chancellor, but where
the voice came from no one could tell.
The Chancellor started.</p>

<p>‘Did you say that?’ said the
Princess.</p>

<p>‘Not the second time,’ answered
Merrymineral.</p>

<p>‘Who could it be?’ said the
Princess; ‘for there is no one in the
room except the cherished Owl; and
you can’t speak, can you, Owl dear?’</p>

<p>The Owl shook his head dismally.
But the change that came over Merrymineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was most astonishing as his
eye suddenly lit upon the Owl—for
since his entrance he had not raised
his eyes from the floor. He jumped
backwards over three rows of seats, for
you see the seats in the audience
chamber were arranged in rows, and he
alighted in a sitting posture on the
other side. As he sat on the floor he
looked up at the Owl in a terrified
manner, then threw up his arms and
fainted. The poor Princess did not
know what to do, so she rang a bell
that stood on the table in front of the
throne. Several pages at once came in.</p>

<p>‘Just bring that man to,’ said the
Princess.</p>

<p>The pages bowed low, and went and
shook the Chancellor violently. He
showed no signs of recovering, so one
of the pages turned to the Princess
and said:</p>

<p>‘May it please your Majesty, but the
Chancellor refuses to come to, and we
can’t bring him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>‘So he refuses to obey my orders,’
said the Princess. ‘He must be
punished for this. However, now go
and get a bucketful of water and
pour it on him. Perhaps that will
bring him to.’</p>

<p>Now when she said he was to be
punished, she was only joking, but she
said it very gravely, so that many
people might have thought it was quite
in earnest. Meanwhile the pages departed
to fetch the water. They soon
came back and brought a large pailful.</p>

<p>‘You had better not throw it all
over him,’ said the Princess; ‘just let
it trickle over his face gently.’</p>

<p>So one of the pages began to do as
he was told, but somehow—either he
had a sudden push, or, as he said afterwards,
the Owl looked at him, and
startled him—he let the pail go, and all
the water and the pail too fell over the
unlucky Chancellor. This really did
bring him very much to—much too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to, in fact—for he sprang up in such a
rage that the Princess really wished
herself out of the room.</p>

<p>‘You jackanapes,’ he screamed at
the unfortunate page; ‘you ape, you
boar, you cow, you clumsy monkey,
I’ll be revenged on you.’</p>

<p>But the Princess, who had gained
courage while he was screaming, said:</p>

<p>‘You will not be revenged on
him.’</p>

<p>‘But I shall,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Indeed you will not,’ said the
Princess, ‘for he did it by my orders.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! he did it by your orders,’ said
the Chancellor; ‘then I’ll be revenged
on you too,’ and he began to move
uncomfortably near to the Princess.
But the three pages threw themselves
on him and tried to drag him back,
but he turned suddenly on them.</p>

<p>‘What,’ he said scornfully, ‘you try
to stop me—ye frogs! Ah! a good
idea—by virtue of my magic power I
command you to turn into water-rats;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
then perhaps the Owl there will eat
you up.’</p>

<p>No sooner said than done, and the
three pages instantly became water-rats,
squattering in the water that was still
in a pool on the floor.</p>

<p>Somehow the Princess did not seem
to be at all frightened at this; she was
only very angry.</p>

<p>‘I thought I told you not to hurt
those pages.’</p>

<p>‘Who cares what you say?’</p>

<p>‘Dear me,’ thought the Princess,
‘he is getting excessively insolent—I
shall have to be severe with him in a
moment.’ So she said:</p>

<p>‘Turn those pages back again.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not.’</p>

<p>‘Then leave the room.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not.’</p>

<p>The Princess did not know what to
do; he was really very rude, and he
was walking towards her evidently
intending to attack her. When he
was within ten feet of her he stopped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and though he tried to get nearer he
could not.</p>

<p>‘Ha! ha!’ he cried; ‘you think to
keep me off by magic, but it is not so
easy, I can tell you. By virtue of my
magic power I command you to turn
into a mouse.’</p>

<p>But the Princess, leaning her head
against the soft feathers of the Owl,
only smiled, and did not turn into a
mouse at all.</p>

<p>The Chancellor seemed perplexed.</p>

<p>‘Is that not enough for you?’ he
said; ‘I thought I told you to turn
into a mouse.’</p>

<p>But the Princess smiled calmly and
said:</p>

<p>‘Do you suppose I am going to
do anything of the sort—you have
forgotten your manners to speak to
your Queen thus. I believe there is
a fine of five shillings for any one who
speaks to the King or Queen without
saying “Your Majesty.” You had better
pay it, Sir Chancellor, and turn those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
pages back again, or I shall have you
turned out of the kingdom.’</p>

<p>But the Chancellor laughed. ‘You
can’t send me out if you wanted to.
Meanwhile I shall not turn those rats
back, for if I am not much mistaken
your Owl there will carry them off.’</p>

<p>It really seemed as if the Owl were
going to obey him, for greatly to the
Princess’s surprise it sprang off her
shoulder and seized the three rats, one
in each claw, and one in its beak—but
it returned at once to her and laid
them squeaking on the table in front
of her—but no sooner did they touch
the table than they turned into men
again just as quickly as they had
become rats. When Merrymineral
saw this he became perfectly frantic,
and tried in vain to get at the Princess—he
even went back a little and tried
to run at her—but it was no use, for
no sooner did he reach a certain spot
than he was suddenly stopped, just as
if he had run against a wall. At last he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
became so frantic that the Princess
could stand it no longer. So she
said:</p>

<p>‘Will you be quiet, you naughty old
man?—leave the room or I will send
for the police.’</p>

<p>But Merrymineral answered:</p>

<p>‘Oh, send for the police and the
soldiers and sailors and candlestick-makers.’</p>

<p>So the Princess rang the bell that
stood on the table: a page at once
appeared at the door.</p>

<p>‘Send for a policeman and ask him
to step this way.’</p>

<p>The page looked astonished, but he
saluted and left the room. Almost
immediately a policeman came in—for
you see there was one always on the
palace steps. He entered the room
with a low bow.</p>

<p>‘Take the Chancellor out of the
room,’ said the Princess, ‘and put him
in prison for three days.’</p>

<p>But the policeman shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Excuse me, mum—I mean your
most gracious Majesty—but it is
against the law to imprison a member
of Parliament, much less a chancellor.’</p>

<p>The Chancellor laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>‘Oh, is it?’ said the Princess; ‘never
mind, take him into custody; I depose
him—he is no longer Chancellor.’</p>

<p>Merrymineral looked astonished,
but the policeman cleared his throat
and said:</p>

<p>‘Come, I say, young fellow; will you
go quietly, or shall I make you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, make me, by all means,’
answered Merrymineral.</p>

<p>So the policeman advanced and
held out his hand to take him by the
collar, but had no sooner touched
Merrymineral than he fell to the
ground as if he had been thunderstruck.</p>

<p>The Chancellor smiled. ‘I told
you so,’ he said.</p>

<p>The Princess was now thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
nonplussed. However, she rang the
bell again. Again the page appeared.</p>

<p>‘Summon the Lords of the Council;
let them come here at once.’</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards the
lords appeared. As they came in each
one bowed profoundly to the Princess.
But in spite of their grave appearance
they could not help looking astonished
at the policeman, who was lying on
the floor, and at the three pages who
were still sitting on the table—for as
they had not yet been told to go they
could not depart.</p>

<p>But each one took his seat without
questioning. Last of all came the
Court doctor, who looked in an alarmed
manner at the Owl—nevertheless he
took his seat.</p>

<p>When all was quiet the Princess
began to speak.</p>

<p>‘My lords,’ she said, ‘I have been
obliged to assemble you on the first
day of my reign; but the matter is a
very grave one. I have found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
necessary to dismiss the Chancellor,
for these reasons: first, he attacked
these three pages who were executing
my bidding; next, he attacked me; and
lastly, he attacked the law, in the
person of the policeman there, whom
he knocked down. Now I ask your
advice as to how I am to get rid of
him, for he refuses to leave the room
at my command.’</p>

<p>So spoke the Princess, but before any
one could answer Merrymineral spoke:</p>

<p>‘My lords,’ he said, ‘are we, we,
the lords of the kingdom, to be governed
by this schoolgirl, who is not even a
magician as we are? What good has
she ever done us? What power is to
keep us from deposing her and electing
as a ruler one of ourselves?’——but
before he could finish a perfect uproar
of shouts of rage interrupted him.</p>

<p>The Princess put her fingers in her
ears to keep out the sound, and when
the lords saw that the noise was
annoying her they stopped at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
When they were quiet the Princess
spoke again:</p>

<p>‘What he has just said is right,’ she
said; ‘I have no right to reign over
you, for I am but a girl. Do ye therefore
elect a ruler.’</p>

<p>For a moment all was silence in the
Council, but all eyes were turned on a
lord who stood next to Merrymineral
in rank. He was a portly man, and a
great magician too, though his power
was not quite so great as Merrymineral’s.
When therefore he saw
that all eyes were turned on him,
Lord Licec, for so he was called,
rose.</p>

<p>‘Your most gracious Majesty,’ he
began, ‘although you had no need to
command us to elect a ruler, we are
of course bound to obey your commands,
whatever they are. I therefore
speak, giving my vote, and I believe the
vote of all the rest of the assembly, that
you shall be our ruler according to the
oath which we sware to your father.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>And then turning to the rest of the
assembly he said:</p>

<p>‘Am I not right, my lords?’ and
with one voice they answered:</p>

<p>‘We will die for our Queen Ismara.’</p>

<p>Only one voice objected, but as
that was Merrymineral, no one noticed
him.</p>

<p>So the Princess rose and thanked
them for their confidence in her,
though, to tell the truth, she had
known all along what they would say.
That done she said:</p>

<p>‘And now what are we to do about
turning this man out? for he refuses to
go of his own accord.’</p>

<p>No one could suggest anything
better than to send for the Lifeguards
and let them carry him off. But
before this was done they decided to
try to persuade him to go. But it was
of no use, for he stood on the spot
where he had stopped, with his arms
folded and his hat on, looking down
at the ground in a brown study, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
took no notice of anything they could
do, even though they rang the bell close
to his ear. Now he did no particular
harm as he stood there, but you see
no one could tell whom he might
attack next. So they determined to
send for the Lifeguards as a last
resource.</p>

<p>So they were sent for, and in a short
time they came, although they left
their horses outside in the courtyard.
Fifty of them were then marched into
the hall and they were ordered to
move the man out. So they divided
into two parties of twenty-five each,
and they put a rope round him, and
each body of twenty-five took an end
of the rope and pulled, but it was no
good, for he took no more notice of
the pulling than if he had been Samson
or any other strong man. So the
fifty gave up the attempt in despair;
the only thing to do seemed to be
to cut him to pieces. So they drew
their swords and hacked at him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
but it was no use: the swords bent or
broke just as if they had been bulrushes
or paper, and still Merrymineral
took no notice in particular. So they
gave up the attempt in despair when
they had broken up all their swords.
However, they did not give in, for they
called in the best horseman in the
regiment and told him to charge on
horseback with his lance in rest. So
the soldier rode in on his horse; this
was not so difficult as it may seem, for
the council chamber was on a level
with the ground, and a lane was opened
in between the chairs to where Merrymineral
still stood with his arms folded.</p>

<p>At the word of command the soldier
rode at full speed towards Merrymineral,
aiming his lance at the centre
of his face—that is his nose. His
aim was true, and the lance hit fair,
but it might just as well have been
made of macaroni, for it crumbled
just as a stick of that delightful eatable
would do if you ran it against a wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The horse, however, swerved just in
time, although it pushed against him
in going by; but even this made no
difference to Merrymineral. As a last
resource they suggested putting a
lighted match under his nose. Whether
this would have succeeded or not I
can’t say. But just at this moment
Merrymineral seemed to wake up
again.</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ he said, ‘I see you have not
yet managed to get me out of the
room. However, as your soldiers
have been practising on me for some
time past, I think it only right that I
should try my hand on them a little.
I used to be thought rather strong in
the arms at one time, and I have cut
down a good many trees in my time.
Just see how you like that,’ he said to
the man on the horse as he swung his
umbrella round his head and brought
it down with a tremendous thwack on
the horse’s side. In fact he hit so
hard that the horse and man were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
knocked right through the window into
the courtyard below. With three more
blows he knocked twenty more of the
men through the same window, and the
rest made their escape as fast as they
could by the door.</p>

<p>‘I see I have not quite forgotten
how to clear a room yet,’ he said,
as he once more folded his arms in
the same attitude and relapsed into
silence.</p>

<p>‘What <i>am</i> I to do?’ said the poor
Princess, wringing her hands and
almost crying with vexation.</p>

<p>A voice came from the far end of
the room, and every one turned to
see who it might be. And all saw it
was the Court physician who spoke.
‘If I might be allowed to make a
suggestion,’ he said, ‘I would say that
the best thing your Majesty could do
would be to request that gentleman
who is sitting on your shoulder to turn
him out. From my own experience I
should say he was very competent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
perform such a task. And if I might
be allowed to add yet another suggestion
it would be, “to be well shaken
before taken,” as they say in prescriptions.’</p>

<p>As he said this an extraordinary
change came over Merrymineral. He
pressed his hat on his head, put his
umbrella under his arm, and began to
put on his gloves in such a hurry that
he mistook the left for the right hand.
As he did so he said:</p>

<p>‘Do you know, I can’t stop any
longer; so sorry, but I have an engagement
and I am rather in a hurry.
Good-day.’ And he began to walk
quickly towards the door. But the
Princess had already whispered to
the Owl, ‘Catch him, dear Owl.’</p>

<p>And however fast he went the Owl
caught him up, and taking him by the
middle of his coat-tails—and I am
bound to say some of his skin too—he
shook him violently, and flew round
and round the room banging him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
violently against any high piece of
furniture that was convenient.</p>

<p>‘O-o-o-h,’ shrieked the wretched
man, ‘I say, do you know you’re
tearing my best coat, and your beak
is awfully sharp? O-o-ouch,’ and he
filled the room with his shrieks. After
they had continued like that for some
minutes the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘I think he has been punished enough
now, cherished Owl, so let him down.’</p>

<p>The Owl did as he was told, not,
however, without giving him a sly
tweak with his bill that must have hurt
him a good deal.</p>

<p>‘I’ll be revenged on you,’ roared
Merrymineral; ‘you’ve spoilt my Sunday
coat, and I shan’t be able to afford
another for I don’t know how long.
I’ll be revenged on you.’ And he
took out a red pocket-handkerchief
and began to suage the blood that was
coming from the bite, all the while
abusing the Owl and the Princess and
threatening to be revenged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You had better be quiet and go,’
she said.</p>

<p>‘I shall not.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well,’ she answered,
perhaps you would like to try the
Owl again.’</p>

<p>At the same time the Owl gave him
such a look from its gleaming eyes
that he turned first red and then white
with fright. He made a dash for the
window, and he was in such a hurry
that he left his umbrella and one of
his gloves behind him.</p>

<p>He jumped right through the window
high into the air, and as soon as
he got outside, strange to say, he began
to burn furiously, and he went gradually
up into the sky like a fire-balloon—just
as when a piece of tissue paper is put
on the fire, if you are not careful, it
will fly blazing up the chimney.</p>

<p>They watched him out of sight, and
then the Princess said with a little sigh
of relief:</p>

<p>‘That’s an end of him at last.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Owl shook his head—he
knew better.</p>

<p>When he was thus at last got rid off
the Princess said to the physician:</p>

<p>‘How can we ever thank thee
enough, good doctor, for thy timely
suggestion!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, your Majesty,’ said the blushing
doctor, ‘experience does it; and I
had plenty of that this morning. Do
you know, I think I shall never be free
again from pain—although I have
bathed in opodeldoc and arnica, and
I am clothed from head to foot in
Court plaster.’</p>

<p>The Princess smiled and said:</p>

<p>‘I am afraid the Owl is a little over-vigorous
in such matters; however, I
will give orders to the Court apothecary
to supply you with remedies at
my expense until you shall be cured.’
She then said to the three pages who
still sat on the table:</p>

<p>‘I must ask you to depart now as
Parliament cannot carry on business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with strangers in the house. However,
ye are, I believe, pages; I will
turn over a new leaf and will advance
you each a step in rank. Now, however,
go.’</p>

<p>Thanking her profusely they went.
When they had gone the Princess
turned to the Councillors and said:</p>

<p>‘As there seems no further need to
keep you, I will detain you no longer.’</p>

<p>Having her permission the Councillors
left the hall. Last of all was
Lord Licec, and he remained as if
hesitating whether to go, or to stay and
speak to the Princess. She, noticing
his hesitation, said:</p>

<p>‘Ah, Lord Licec, hast thou something
to ask me?’</p>

<p>The old lord made answer:</p>

<p>‘I would ask your Majesty’s permission
to enter the room of the late
King, your Majesty’s father, for, as you
are aware, it is against the law to enter
the royal presence without the royal
permission.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You have my permission of course;
but ought not some preparations to be
made for the funeral?’</p>

<p>Lord Licec answered:</p>

<p>‘They are already made. For as
the late King had announced his
intention of dying yesterday at half-past
six <small>P.M.</small>, there was ample time.’</p>

<p>‘Let us then go together to the
room, my lord,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>So they went together, the Princess
leaning on Licec’s arm, and the Owl
sitting on her shoulder.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" width="321" height="571" alt="princess flying in the on owl" />
</div>

<p>The guards of the room saluted as
they passed in, but what was their
astonishment on entering to find that
the King had disappeared. When they
asked the guards who had come into
the room during the day, they replied
that no one had been near the room
during their watch, and the guards of
the watch before said exactly the same
thing. All over the palace inquiries
were made, but to no purpose, and the
rumour gradually spread to the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and throngs of anxious citizens flocked
about the palace gates to ask, but
neither they nor any one else ever
heard what had become of him, and it
is my opinion that the King himself is
the only person who knew anything
about it. It came out in the course
of inquiries that when the attendants
had rushed in on hearing the Princess’s
call for assistance the night before,
they had not seen the King on the bed,
but in his place had sat an enormous
owl, and this owl had insisted on
accompanying the Princess wherever
she went.</p>

<p>This was the first time that the
Princess had heard of how the Owl
had come to her, but still she had
known all along that the Owl was the
one her father had made her promise
to cherish. But there were ill-natured
people who said that it was not so
very unlikely that the Owl had eaten
the King up, but the Princess only
laughed and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>‘How could the Owl eat a king up
when the poor thing has so little
appetite that it only eats very small
pieces of meat off my golden fork at
dinner?’</p>

<p>And so the Owl remained with the
Princess: during the day it always
sat on her shoulder, or took short
flights round her head, and at night it
slept on the foot of her bed.</p>

<p>So six weeks glided peacefully away,
and everything prospered; but one
day a terrified messenger rode into the
city at full speed, and the message that
he brought was this.</p>

<p>Merrymineral, who, as the Owl had
said, was by no means done with, had
been inciting the people of far-off
lands such as Mesopotamia and Padan-Aram
and Ireland to rebel, and he
was now marching against the Princess
at the head of an immense army,
laying waste the country for miles
around. At the rate he was coming,
however, it would take him a fortnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to get near the country round. So
you see there was no immediate
danger; still an enemy’s army could
not be allowed to remain in the
country unopposed. So the Princess
gave Lord Licec the order to assemble
the army, and, as you may imagine,
it was an immense one when it did
assemble. I can’t say how large it
was, but if you could have stood on a
hill in the centre of the town you
would have seen nothing for miles
around but shining silk banners and
glistening helmets and lances. Never
before had the world held such an
army, and it never will again. Yet this
army even was hardly as large as that
of the enemy. The command of the
army was given to Lord Licec, for he
was well known to be the most prudent
man in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Three days passed till the last of
the army had started, and all the while
the Princess stood at the window and
watched them march along the winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
street below, and the knights and
men-at-arms were inspired with fresh
courage at the sight of such a princess
as they had to defend, and they
cheered so loud and long that it
seemed like the continual roar of the
sea beating on a rocky shore, sometimes
rising, sometimes falling, but
always sounding.</p>

<p>The Princess indeed felt quite
lonely when they had all gone, even
though their shouts did make her
head ache. However, she consoled
herself by riding all day towards the
army, and returning at night to the
lonely town. So she occupied three
days; and the Owl always flew over
her head, protecting her from the sun
when it was too hot, or else sitting on
her shoulder, or on the horse’s head,
although the horse did not like it at all.</p>

<p>For three days no news came, but
on the fourth as the Princess was
riding out with her ladies-in-waiting
she saw at a great distance in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
her along the straight white road a
cloud of dust that was coming swiftly
towards her. As it came nearer she
could see the glint of armour, and
soon she could plainly see the form
of an armed knight galloping at full
speed towards them. He came so fast
that they had to rein their horses to
one side that they might not be run
down. At first he did not seem to
know who the Princess was, or perhaps
he was going so furiously that he
could not see; at any rate he had
almost got past them before he recognised
her. As soon as he did,
however, he drew up, but so sudden
was the action that the horse first
sank back on his haunches, and then
bounded so high into the air that
the marks that his hoofs made when
he alighted on the ground again, were
a foot deep in the hard road. As
soon as the plunging of the horse
stopped and the Princess could make
herself heard she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What news, Sir Knight, from the
front, that thou ridest in such haste?’</p>

<p>‘But bad news, I fear,’ answered the
knight.</p>

<p>‘What say you?’ said the Princess;
‘bad news, and with such an army as
ye had? has some fresh rebellion
broken out among the men?’</p>

<p>‘No rebellion, but plain fighting has
beaten us—but what can we do
against such foes? This Merrymineral,
alone, rides on a green dragon, and
with one stroke of his sword he kills a
hundred men. Myself I charged him
with my lance, but as it struck his
shield it broke in pieces as if it had
been made of glass; and it was
fortunate for me that my horse carried
me past him before he could strike me,
for I saw him myself cut the Knight of
Pendred in half, as you would cut a
radish. And if we slay a thousand
men during the day he restores them
in the night. So we have gradually
been driven back, till after three days’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
fighting the army remains at Arecarp.
Thence I started at eight this morning
to hurry the reinforcements from
Britain and Gaul.’</p>

<p>‘Alas! they are still at three days’
march from here, though they are
marching night and day. But thou
saidst the army was at Arecarp, and
that thou didst start to-day at eight in
the morning. That is impossible.
Arecarp is twenty-four hours’ journey
for a fast horse, and it is now but
twelve o’clock. Not even the horse
that I ride could go faster than that,
though he is said to be the fastest horse
in the world, except Selim, the horse of
the Prince of India. However, no
time is to be lost. Sir Knight, will you
escort these ladies back to the town,
and rest for a while?’</p>

<p>‘But what will you do, your
Majesty?’</p>

<p>‘I must ride forward to Arecarp.’</p>

<p>‘To Arecarp! Your Majesty, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
will you do there? The battlefield is
no place for a girl.’</p>

<p>‘Nevertheless I must go, for my
place is with the army.’</p>

<p>‘But if you are killed what will
happen to your people without their
Queen?’</p>

<p>‘What do they do now without
their Queen? Besides once before
the cherished Owl has defeated this
man and he may do it again. If he
does not, no power on earth could
save me from death, for the army is
being gradually defeated.’</p>

<p>‘But your Majesty could send the
Owl in a cage against the enemy.’</p>

<p>‘I promised my father never to go
out of its sight—no, I must go.’</p>

<p>‘I beseech you then, your Majesty,
to allow me to accompany you, for
the road to the camp is full of
danger.’</p>

<p>‘But your horse is tired, and even if
he were not he could never keep up
with me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But if you will excuse the contradiction,
I think I shall.’</p>

<p>‘Well then, have your own way, but
mark me, if you lag behind I shall not
stop. However, we are losing time.
Let us go.’</p>

<p>And they set off—the Princess
ignoring the entreaties of the ladies
that she should not go.</p>

<p>The Princess immediately started at
the full speed of her horse, expecting
that the knight would soon fall behind;
but no, he galloped at her side as if
the speed were not more than usual,
and his great black charger seemed to
enjoy the exercise as though he had not
already galloped over a hundred miles
that morning.</p>

<p>The Princess could not understand
how it was, but she thought he would
soon get tired and fall behind, but
an hour passed and he showed no
signs of being fatigued. So she
leant over her horse and whispered
softly in his ear. Instantly the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bounded forward more swiftly than
ever—so fast, indeed, that she could
hardly keep her eyes open against the
wind, and her golden crown was
suddenly whisked away, and her
beautiful golden hair streamed far out
behind. Still the knight kept up, and
seemed not the least distressed at the
speed. The Owl meanwhile was flying
far overhead, but she was not at all
surprised at his keeping up, for nothing
seemed impossible to him. After
they had been riding thus for nearly
two hours they came to a place where
the path was crossed by a river, and
here the Princess thought it advisable
to stop and rest a moment and to let
the horses drink. So she called to
the knight to stop, as she was going
to get off for a moment, and he at
once sprang off his horse, and coming
to her saddle-bow held her stirrup for
her to dismount. When she was off
she leaned against a tree looking at
the horses as they drank eagerly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the river, and then came out to browse
for a moment on the bank. Then she
went to where the knight’s horse stood,
and patted him on the neck, for you see
he was not a very fierce-looking animal,
and she was not at all afraid of him.</p>

<p>‘He’s a wonderfully swift horse, Sir
Knight,’ she said suddenly, ‘and I
believe there is no other horse in the
world as swift—not even Selim—the
horse I spoke about—that belongs to
the Prince of India.’</p>

<p>The knight nodded.</p>

<p>‘He is a good horse, but he is no
better than Selim, your Majesty, for I
know Selim very well.’</p>

<p>All this while he had kept his vizor
down, and the Princess had been too
polite to ask him to raise it, even
though it was rather rude of him to
keep it down. So she could not tell
who he was. She knew all the knights
of her own kingdom by sight, as well as
most of her allies, for you must know
that a great many foreign princes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sent her troops to assist her against the
rebel. She looked at the device on
his shield; it was a crowned tiger, but
that did not help her, for she did not
know whose crest it was. So at last
when she could bear her curiosity no
longer, she determined to ask him.
So she said:</p>

<p>‘Sir Knight, should you think me very
rude if I were to ask you whether you
are under a vow of hiding your face?’</p>

<p>‘I am bound by no such vow; but
why do you ask, your Majesty?’</p>

<p>‘Because ever since I have seen you
you have kept your vizor down, and I
thought perhaps it was on account of
some such vow.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I beg your pardon a thousand
times, your Majesty,’ said the knight.
‘But I did not remember that I had
let it down, for you see I look through
its bars without noticing the difference.
But I hope your Majesty will pardon
the absent-mindedness,’ and he raised
the vizor, at the same time bowing low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to her. But it was now the Princess’s
turn to be confused, for she saw before
her Sir Alured the Emperor of India,
a prince nearly as powerful as herself.
She blushed with shame and then said:</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sir Knight, I mean your Royal
Highness, it is I who should crave
your pardon, for all the while I have
addressed you as “Sir Knight,” instead
of as “your Majesty.” But I am very
sorry.’</p>

<p>But Sir Alured said:</p>

<p>‘Nay, your Majesty, you have the
right to call me what you will, for I
am always your humble vassal.’</p>

<p>‘My ally, you should say, your
Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘I am always your servant, not your
ally, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘Then I fear you will soon be the
vassal of a queen without a kingdom;
and if this Merrymineral prevail over
me, I fear he will punish you for
having aided me.’</p>

<p>But the Prince said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>‘All is not yet lost, your Majesty,
and whatever happens your Majesty
will always have a protector while I
am alive.’</p>

<p>The Princess smiled.</p>

<p>‘Ah! you mean the cherished Owl.
You will always protect me, won’t you,
Owl?’ she said, looking up at the Owl
who was seated again on her shoulder.
And the Owl nodded his head.</p>

<p>She looked at her watch just then.
‘Why,’ she said, ‘we have been here
just ten minutes, and it is time to start
again, if you are rested sufficiently.’</p>

<p>So he helped her to mount, and
they crossed the river. It was not
very deep, but still she got the skirts
of her dress quite wet, for the water
was high enough for that.</p>

<p>However, the gallop in the hot sun
on the other side soon dried them.</p>

<p>In an hour and a half they were on
the top of a hill from which they could
see the town of Arecarp in the valley
beneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly on the
tents of the army as it lay round the
town, and at some distance the camp
of the enemy appeared. But still all
looked peaceful.</p>

<p>The Prince gazed carefully at the
armies. After a moment he said:</p>

<p>‘There has been no fighting since I
left the city this morning, nor has the
position altered at all. I fancy Merrymineral
has sent ambassadors to demand
surrender from Lord Licec.’</p>

<p>The Princess smiled.</p>

<p>‘He will never surrender,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Nor will any of us, your Majesty,’
added the Prince. ‘However, let us
descend the hill.’</p>

<p>Down the hill the road lay through
a deep gorge, so deep that the sun did
not penetrate it, and it lay in delicious
shade. The sides of the valley were
lined with the silver-barked birch,
below which grew nodding foxgloves,
and as they went slowly down the steep
path, ever and anon a rabbit would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
scuttle out of the grassy track to a safe
distance in front of them, where it sat
on its haunches with its little ears
pricked up, smelling at them anxiously
as they came near again, and then it
would scutter along into the thick rank
grass to its home.</p>

<p>So they went slowly down the path
until they came once more to the level
ground, and they were again able to
gallop on.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the town, and
clattered through the cobbled streets
to the market-place, where Lord Licec
had his head-quarters. But the
market-place was crowded with soldiers
and knights who were bargaining for
food, so that it was by no means easy
to get through the crowd. However,
as soon as they got near the
place, the soldiers recognised the
Princess and began to cheer, and
immediately an avenue was formed
up to the door of the council-house,
and the Princess rode smiling through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the throng, followed by the
Prince.</p>

<p>The news of her arrival ran through
the whole camp, and immediately such
a shout went up from the men that
the enemy thought they were preparing
for battle, and they made ready to resist
the attack. At the door of the council-hall
Lord Licec was waiting with the
rest of the captains of renown, and they
followed the Princess upstairs to the
council-chamber.</p>

<p>As soon as they were seated the
Princess asked for the latest news.
She was told all that had happened,
and when she had heard it she
dismissed the Lords of the Council,
all except Lord Licec and the Prince
of India, who were to stay and dine
with her, and she gave orders that the
dinner should be brought as soon as
possible, for to tell the truth she felt
rather hungry, as she had had nothing
to eat since breakfast-time.</p>

<p>Now when the Princess had finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
giving her orders about the dinner,
Licec could not refrain from asking her
why she had come.</p>

<p>‘Was it not rather foolish,’ he said,
‘to hazard your life for nothing? for of
a truth you are——’</p>

<p>But the Princess put her finger on
his mouth.</p>

<p>‘I will not be bullied by you, my
lord, even though you are old enough
to be my father. I know what you
were going to say—that the battlefield
is no place for girls. Now I won’t be
called a girl, for I’m nineteen, you
know. His Majesty the Emperor of
India there insulted me by calling me
a girl, and I have not forgiven him yet.
Besides you’ll spoil my appetite for
dinner if you lecture me. It always
does; so do be quiet now, at any rate
till after dinner.’</p>

<p>So Licec had to be quiet, and they
talked about something else till dinner-time.</p>

<p>Just as they had finished, a frightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
shouting outside made them drop their
dessert knives and run to the window,
but as the window did not face on to
the street they could not tell what was
the matter. So the Princess rang the
bell, and when the servant appeared
she asked him what was the cause of
the shouting.</p>

<p>‘May it please your Majesty, ambassadors
have arrived from the enemy
and would speak to you.’</p>

<p>‘Show them this way and send at
the same time for the Lords of the
Council.’</p>

<p>So the servant went, and in a short
time a heavy stumping was heard on
the stairs. Suddenly the door burst
open and the ambassadors entered.
They were a rather remarkable pair
of ambassadors, although they could
hardly be said to pair well. For the
one was an enormous giant with a
long beard, dressed in leaves mostly,
and so tall that he could not stand upright
in the room; in his hand he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
carried an enormous pole, from the
end of which a spiked ball dangled.
The other, however, was very nearly
his opposite in everything. For he
was very small, a dwarf in fact, and he
was dressed in very tight yellow armour,
and from the top of his helmet a crest
of red roses hung down to his saddle—for
you must know he had insisted on
not getting off his horse, or rather pony,
for that too was very small—in fact it
just fitted the dwarf.</p>

<p>As soon as the Princess had recovered
from her astonishment, she
rose from her seat and said:</p>

<p>‘Are you the ambassadors from the
rebel Merrymineral?’</p>

<p>The dwarf replied:</p>

<p>‘I don’t know anything about the
rebel part of the business, but we are
the ambassadors from Merrymineral,
whom we are bound to serve for a
certain time. But who are you, I
should like to know, and what right
have you to speak to me in this insulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
manner? D’you think I’m
here to be insulted by you? If you
think so, I’ll tell you point-blank I’m
not—so there.’ And in the rage he
had worked himself into he began to
spur his steed till it jumped off the
floor so high that it knocked his
head against the ceiling.</p>

<p>The Princess was not used to being
treated like that. However she was not
at all angry at it—she only laughed at
his misfortune, which made him all the
more outrageous.</p>

<p>‘How dare you laugh at me?’ he
screamed; ‘who are you, you minx,
you minx, you lynx—you——’</p>

<p>But the Princess did not listen to
him. She turned to the giant, who at
any rate was quiet, and said:</p>

<p>‘Will you not take a chair until the
Lords of the Council arrive?’</p>

<p>The giant looked at her in stupid
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘What shall I do with the chair
when I’ve taken it?’ he mumbled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I mean you to sit down on it, of
course,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>The giant growled out in reply:</p>

<p>‘Well, I never sat on a chair before,
but to please you I will.’</p>

<p>So he sat down, but as he was not
used to sitting on chairs he sat down
on its back; but it was only a small
cane-bottomed chair, and as he was
very big, and the chair was very small,
the result is easily foreseen, for the
chair collapsed under him as if he
had sat on a top-hat, and he reclined
comfortably on the floor, where he
remained for the rest of the time.</p>

<p>‘I think I’ll stop where I am,’ he
said, when they offered him a wooden
stool to sit on, ‘for you see I’m not
used to chairs.’ So they let him stop
where he was.</p>

<p>One by one the Lords of the Council
began to arrive; they looked curiously
at the ambassadors but said nothing.
When they were all arrived the Princess
said to the dwarf:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Now if you will state your message
we will listen.’</p>

<p>So the dwarf snarled in a bad-tempered
voice:</p>

<p>‘I shan’t tell you—you aren’t the
commander-in-chief of the army, are
you?’</p>

<p>‘No, but I am the Queen of the
Western World.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! you’re the Queen of the
Western World, are you? Well, you
won’t be Queen of the Western World
long, if you don’t mind your P’s and
Q’s. The king Merrymineral sent me
to say that if you don’t marry him and
make him king, he’ll kill the lot of
you and make himself king in spite of
you—so there; and I’m to wait for an
answer.’</p>

<p>After consulting the Council for a
moment the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘Of course I shan’t marry him—how
could he be so ridiculous as to
think so?’</p>

<p>The dwarf laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That’s your answer, is it?’ he said.
‘I thought so. I say, Gog, have you
written it down?’</p>

<p>But Gog had gone to sleep. So
the dwarf pricked him with the end of
his lance.</p>

<p>‘I say, Gog,’ he said, ‘she’s given
her answer and you haven’t written
it down, and I’ve forgotten it
already. Just say it over again,
Queen, will you? and not too fast,
or Gog here will never get it down.’</p>

<p>The giant now drew from his pocket
a very soiled and crumpled half-sheet
of a copy-book and began to write
from the Princess’s dictation.</p>

<p>‘Of course I should not do anything
so——’ Here he stopped.</p>

<p>‘How do you spell “ridiculous”?’
he said.</p>

<p>‘With two “k’s,” of course,’ said
the dwarf; ‘even I know that, though I
can’t write.’</p>

<p>When he had finished he handed it
to the Princess:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Just sign your name, will you?’</p>

<p>The Princess signed her name, but
she could not help seeing that the
writing was very bad and the spelling
was awful.</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t they send some one
who could write better? Why! that
“r” is more like a “k” than an “r”.’</p>

<p>But the giant shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>‘They hadn’t got any one else in the
army who could write except Merrymineral,
and he was afraid to come.’</p>

<p>‘But weren’t you afraid to come?’
she said.</p>

<p>The giant shook his mace round so
violently that it grazed the helmet of
the dwarf, and cut his crest of roses
off.</p>

<p>‘Whom am I to be afraid of?’ he
growled. ‘I could kill your whole
army single-handed’; and he laughed
loud and long.</p>

<p>But just at this moment the Owl,
that had been sitting on the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
behind the Princess’s chair, flew up on
to her shoulder, and no sooner did the
giant see the Owl than he jumped up
from the floor, where you remember
he was sitting, and he was in such
a hurry that he knocked a hole in
the plaster of the ceiling with his
head.</p>

<p>‘Come, I say, you know,’ he said, ‘I
can fight anything in reason—but I’m
not going to tackle that, you know;
besides, we’re ambassadors, and you
can’t hurt us. I’m going’; and he
rushed out of the room as fast as he
could, and the dwarf followed him as
fast as he could make his horse gallop,
and they never stopped till they reached
the camp of Merrymineral. For they
were very frightened, you see.</p>

<p>After they had gone the Princess
again dismissed the Councillors, and
when they had gone, she said to Lord
Licec and the Prince, who by the bye
still remained:</p>

<p>‘Now let us finish our dessert’—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the ambassadors had come in right in
the middle of it.</p>

<p>After a moment the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘How absurd of him to think I
would marry him—why, he’s old
enough to be my great-grandfather.’</p>

<p>But suddenly she became grave:</p>

<p>‘But perhaps I ought to have
thought before I gave the answer.
Would it not have been better for my
people if I had consented? for then he
would kill no more of them.’</p>

<p>But the Prince became quite angry
at such an idea. ‘It’s absurd,’ he
said. ‘Why, as soon as he had married
you and become king he would murder
you and then kill just as many of your
people as he will now; besides, who
knows that we may not still conquer
him?’</p>

<p>The Princess turned to Lord Licec:</p>

<p>‘What do you say, my lord?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘I think just as the Prince of India—for
even if he did not murder you
he would oppress the people without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
mercy, and besides, your people would
never allow you to marry him, so that
is out of the question.’</p>

<p>The Princess gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>‘Since you say so, Lord Licec, it
must be right; besides, I don’t think
I could ever marry him—he is such
a very unpleasant sort of man.’</p>

<p>And the Prince answered:</p>

<p>‘You are quite right there’; and he
seemed quite happy again.</p>

<p>Soon after it became evening, and
Lord Licec had to go out to look after
his army, and the Prince too went to
see that his men were all prepared for
any night attack—for his men were right
in the very front of all, and so they
were quite close to the enemy, who
might at any time begin an attack.</p>

<p>So the Princess was left all alone
with the Owl, but she did not feel
lonely with him, for he was very
sociable, and would do anything that
he was told to do. So they played
hide-and-seek till it was too dark to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
see any more, and then she went to
bed and slept soundly till the rays of
the sun falling on her face the next
morning woke her up. She was soon
dressed, and when she had finished
she went into the next room, where
she found Lord Licec already awaiting
her.</p>

<p>‘What does your Majesty intend to
do this morning? for I shall not be
with you, as I am going to order the
army to advance to the attack, and
so your Majesty had better stay within
the town for the rest of the day.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, I shall do nothing of the
sort,’ she answered. ‘I am going to
lead the army to-day to see if we
cannot regain some ground, for I had
rather die fighting than be driven back
like this, so please don’t say I mustn’t
go; besides, the Owl will protect me;
he promised to; didn’t you, Owl?’
and the Owl nodded.</p>

<p>‘But they may shoot the Owl with
their arrows, and then——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But the Owl before now has
conquered Merrymineral himself, and
he may still do it. Oh, please don’t
tell me not to go. If you’ll only let
me go I’ll promise to keep near the
Prince of India, and he’ll protect me,
even if the Owl can’t.’</p>

<p>‘But the Prince of India is always
in the thickest of the fight, and you
will be in much greater danger if you
keep near him.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, never mind the danger; do let
me go.’</p>

<p>And she begged so hard that Lord
Licec had to give in. She put on
a breastplate and a sword, but she
would not put on a helmet, for she
said that it made her head ache, and
that no one would know who she was if
she covered her face up. So she only
wore a gold circlet on her head, as
she usually did, and besides this she
carried a silver shield with the royal
crest on it, and a small lance just like
a knight’s spear, only not so heavy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
thus mounted on her white horse she
rode to the very front of the line of
battle, and there she found the Prince
of India at the head of his men.</p>

<p>They had already furled their tents
and were quite ready to begin the
battle as soon as the others were ready.</p>

<p>The Prince was very much astonished
when he saw her, for it was the last
place in the world he had expected to
see her in.</p>

<p>‘Do you really mean to say,’ he
exclaimed, ‘that Lord Licec allowed
you to come out to the field of battle?
Why, he must be mad.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, he’s not,’ answered the
Princess; ‘but you see if I only beg
hard enough he’ll let me do whatever
I like, and then I promised to keep
near you, for I thought you would
protect me. However, you don’t
seem very glad to see me—perhaps
you think I shall hinder you—so I’ll
go and ask some one else to take care
of me, as you don’t seem to relish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
task. Good-morning’; and she began
to move off; but she knew very well
that he would not let her go like that,
and to tell the truth she rather hoped
he wouldn’t, for she thought she would
like him to take care of her better
than any one else in the army. Of
course he did stop her and said:</p>

<p>‘If you really insist on stopping on
the field no one is more fit to take
care of you than I. So <i>do</i> stop.’</p>

<p>And she allowed herself to be
persuaded to stop with him.</p>

<p>Just as they had managed to arrange
it so, a trumpet blew in the direction of
the town, and immediately troops of
knights and men-at-arms began to
pour out of the gates, and to form the
line of battle, and as each band of
men came along they cheered long
and loud at the sight of the Princess,
and the Princess felt very happy, for
she liked to know that her people
loved her. Gradually the immense
army came into one long line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
glistening steel, and again the trumpets
sounded, and the line began to move
forward like a wave of the sea as it
runs up the smooth sand sweeping all
before it. The smooth plain which
was to form the battlefield was dotted
here and there with troops of cattle
which had come down in the night
from the hills to feed on the long sweet
grass, and they raised their heads in
astonishment at the line of knights
and bowmen that marched slowly
down on them; so they shook their
heads and galloped off straight in
front of the line, with their tails high
in the air, and they were in such
blind haste that they charged right
through the lines of the enemy who
were now approaching, and not only
through them they went, but also
through their camp, tossing the tents
into the air with their horns as they
went by. However, at last they
reached the hills, and did not disturb
the combatants any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the armies had got quite
close together—so close indeed that
they could see each other’s faces quite
plainly—but they did not seem particularly
eager to fight. So when
they had got thus far they halted, and
looked at one another.</p>

<p>As yet Merrymineral had not arrived,
for to tell the truth he was never a
very early riser, and he did not see why
he should hurry himself—for you see he
was quite sure of winning the battle
without much trouble.</p>

<p>Just opposite the Princess was the
flower of the enemy, and she recognised
many of the great men of the countries
that had rebelled with Merrymineral.
They did not seem particularly happy
where they were, and especially when
the Princess looked at them they
looked very red and uncomfortable, as
if they did not like it at all.</p>

<p>‘I do believe they’re ashamed of
themselves,’ she said to the Prince;
and he answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>‘They certainly look like it.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think,’ she asked, ‘if I
were to go over to them and offer to
pardon them that they would leave
Merrymineral and come on my side?’</p>

<p>The Prince thought a moment.</p>

<p>‘I believe they would,’ he said; ‘only
if I were you I would not go, I should
send an ambassador or a herald.’</p>

<p>But the Princess shook her head.</p>

<p>‘That would never do,’ she said.
‘I’m sure they’d be offended at that.
Why, it would look as if I thought they
were not to be trusted, and besides
they would not hurt me. No, I’ll go
to them quite alone.’</p>

<p>But the Prince said:</p>

<p>‘You had better let me go with you,
for if they did attack you it would
be awkward; besides, you know you
promised to keep near me all the
morning, and if you go without me you
will not be keeping your promise, don’t
you see?’</p>

<p>So the Princess said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose you’re right, only
you must come alone.’</p>

<p>And as he agreed to this they went
forward. Her own army evidently
did not understand what she meant
to do, nor, for the matter of that, did
the enemy, but as they had neither of
them received the order to commence
fighting they neither of them advanced.</p>

<p>So the Prince and Princess advanced
at a gentle trot until they were quite
close to the others, and the Owl sat on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>When they were quite close the
knights tried to get one behind the
other just as if they had done something
they ought not to have done,
and were each afraid of being punished
first.</p>

<p>In particular the Princess noted the
giant and dwarf, the ambassadors of
the evening before; they tried to
hide themselves behind the others
altogether. For the dwarf this was
easy enough, but for the poor giant, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
could not manage it at all, he was so
very big.</p>

<p>However, she did not look at all
angry, and she only said:</p>

<p>‘Good-morning, my lords.’</p>

<p>And they replied in chorus:</p>

<p>‘Good-morning, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>So she went on:</p>

<p>‘I have come to ask you why you
have assisted my rebellious subject,
and what grievance you have? If
there is any I will try to redress it.’</p>

<p>One of the nobles replied:</p>

<p>‘We have no grievances.’</p>

<p>‘Then why have you fought against
me?’</p>

<p>‘Because we could not help it, your
Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘But I should have thought you
could have helped fighting.’</p>

<p>‘I mean, your Majesty, that Merrymineral
threatened to kill us all if we
did not fight.’</p>

<p>‘Then you were not very brave.
But that has nothing to do with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
What I wish to know is, whether you
will now submit to me again?’</p>

<p>‘We would most willingly; only
perhaps your Majesty might inflict
some punishment on us for our misdeeds.’</p>

<p>But the Princess shook her head.</p>

<p>‘No; I will give you all a free
pardon if you return to your allegiance.’</p>

<p>So the nobles gave a shout of joy,
and they seemed quite happy again.
And the Princess too was overjoyed;
however, she ordered them to go each
knight to his own men and to tell
them what had happened, and to
conduct them to her own army.</p>

<p>So they all went and did as they
were told, and soon the whole army of
Merrymineral melted away, with the
exception of a very few, and these
were mostly the servants of Merrymineral
himself, and of the giant and
the dwarf, who still remained faithful
to him. However they seemed quite
unhappy about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Princess turned to them and
said:</p>

<p>‘And you, sirs, will you not also
join me?’</p>

<p>But the giant shook his head, and
the dwarf said snappishly:</p>

<p>‘Don’t you know we can’t?’</p>

<p>But the Princess answered:</p>

<p>‘No; I do not know why you can’t.’</p>

<p>So the dwarf snarled:</p>

<p>‘We’re bound to serve him for a
certain time, whether we like it or not.
I’m the King of the Underground
Gnomes—we live in tunnels under the
earth, and never come up unless we’re
obliged to.’</p>

<p>And the giant said:</p>

<p>‘I’m the Spirit of the Woods—that’s
why I’m dressed in leaves like
this; and I’m the King of the Foresters,
and we live in trees.’</p>

<p>But just at this moment a frightful
roar came from the camp:</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you begin?’ it came.</p>

<p>It was so sudden that it quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
startled the Princess, but the giant
shook his head mournfully:</p>

<p>‘He always roars like that when he’s
in a temper. He’ll be coming out in
a moment, and won’t there be a row?’</p>

<p>Just then the voice came again.</p>

<p>‘Bring Popfelwuski to the door.’</p>

<p>‘Popfelwuski’s his dragon that he
rides on,’ said the giant.</p>

<p>And then some servants led the
dragon to the door of one of the
tents.</p>

<p>It was a most marvellous-looking
creature, for it had eyes as large as
tea-trays, and they twinkled awfully;
and it was golden-coloured all over,
and it shone so brightly in the sun
that it made the Princess’s eyes quite
ache to look at it. And it was
growling and prancing and kicking up
the dust, and making more fuss than
fifty horses could have done. Just
then the tent opened and Merrymineral
came out. He looked just as usual,
and had not any armour or weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
except a huge battle-axe, which must
have weighed nearly a ton, but he
carried it with the greatest ease,
although he was an old man—for he
was over eight hundred years old. He
vaulted on to his dragon’s back with
very great ease, and putting his spurs
to its golden sides made it gallop at a
great rate. As yet he had not seen
what had happened to his army, for he
was rather short-sighted, but when he
had got within a few yards of where
it ought to have been, he suddenly
stopped as if he were bewildered, but
then his eye fell on the Princess and
he roared out:</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s you, is it? I’ll soon do
for you,’ and he made his dragon fly
towards the Princess at a very great
rate. But precisely the same thing
happened now as had happened once
before, for the dragon came to a
sudden stop as if it had hit against a
wall. The Prince of India did not
understand it at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Had we not better retreat and
join the rest of the army?’ he said.</p>

<p>But the Princess answered:</p>

<p>‘Oh no, we’re quite safe here. He
won’t be able to get at us. Only
you’d better come a little closer to me,
because he might be able to hit you.’</p>

<p>So the Prince came a good deal
closer, and they sat watching the frantic
efforts of Merrymineral to get at them,
but it was no use. Suddenly, however,
he changed his mode of attack. He
made his dragon fly high into the air—so
high indeed that it would have been
invisible if its golden coat had not
shone brightly in the sun. It was quite
unpleasant to look at him, for he was
so high up that it made them feel
dizzy as it shone out against the sky,
miles high. Suddenly, however, just
as it was directly over them, it seemed
to be growing larger.</p>

<p>‘I do believe he’s going to drop on
us from above’; and so he was. The
Prince put up his lance that the dragon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
might be spiked on it as it fell. But
he might have saved himself the
trouble, for suddenly, when the thing
had fallen to within a few feet of their
heads, it stopped as if it had fallen on
to the roof of a house, and then it
bounced off again like a ball.</p>

<p>But the Princess had shut her eyes,
so she did not see this; but when she
opened them she saw the dragon and
Merrymineral lying on the grass in a
heap where they had fallen.</p>

<p>But he was soon on his feet again,
and again he tried to charge at the
Princess; but it was no use, and he
only tired himself. At last the Princess
began to get tired too, so she
turned to the Prince and said:</p>

<p>‘I think we’ve had enough of this—don’t
you?’</p>

<p>And he replied:</p>

<p>‘Oh, plenty; but I don’t see how
we’re to get rid of him, unless I go
out and fight him.’</p>

<p>But the Princess answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t think you need do that,
although it’s very good of you to offer—but
you’ve forgotten all about the
Owl.’ So she took the Owl off her
shoulder, and putting it on the horse’s
head with its face to her she asked it:</p>

<p>‘You can drive him away, can’t
you, dear Owl?’</p>

<p>And the Owl nodded gravely. So
the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘Then I wish you would—only
don’t hurt him; only drive him away.’</p>

<p>As she said this a wonderful change
came over the Owl. It began to grow
bigger and bigger, until it quite covered
them over as it spread its wings to
fly. Merrymineral seemed to know
what was coming, for he drew his
steed’s reins up tight and examined
his stirrups and saddle. And then, as
the Owl flew towards him, he tried to
spur the golden dragon against him;
but the dragon refused to move, and
at last it turned and bolted with its tail
between its legs, like a whipped dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Merrymineral tried hard to stop it,
but he might as well have tried to
stop a mad bull. As he could not
stop, and the Owl was catching him
up, he turned in his saddle and hurled
his heavy battle-axe at the Owl; but
the Owl caught it as it flew, and flung
it back with such good aim and force
that it hit the dragon on the back
and cut it clean in half, so that it fell
from under Merrymineral and left him
standing on the ground.</p>

<p>But when he saw that the Owl was
quite close to him, a wonder happened—for
he suddenly caught fire at his
feet and shot up into the air just as
you may have seen a rocket do, and
he shot right away, so that the last
they saw of him was just as he disappeared
over the mountains. But the
Owl flew back to its mistress quite
small again, and it perched once more
on her shoulder as affectionately as
ever. As to the golden dragon, it had
disappeared altogether—and the funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
part was that nothing was heard of it
ever after, and no one knew how it
had gone—so that the only thing that
remained was the battle-axe, and that
took seven men to lift it. However,
the main thing was that Merrymineral
had departed, and there seemed no
likelihood of his returning.</p>

<p>So you may imagine how great the
Princess’s joy was.</p>

<p>As soon as he had quite disappeared,
she said:</p>

<p>‘That really does seem to be the
last of him.’</p>

<p>But the Prince shook his head:</p>

<p>‘You never know when that sort of
man will turn up again; and in the
meantime what are we to do with the
giant and the dwarf? I suppose we
had better attack them at once and
get rid of them.’</p>

<p>‘But why?’ asked the Princess.
‘They don’t seem to want to fight
much, and why should we attack them?
Let us go and ask them to go away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
quietly, and I should think they
will.’</p>

<p>So they went up to where the giant
and the dwarf and their forces were
standing.</p>

<p>‘What are you going to do now?’
she asked of them.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ answered the dwarf,
and the giant too shook his head. So
the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘Will you come and join our rejoicings?’</p>

<p>But the dwarf said:</p>

<p>‘No; I must be going back to my
kingdom, or I don’t know what won’t
happen.’</p>

<p>And the giant said:</p>

<p>‘And I’ll go too, or they might rebel
there just as your subjects have done.’</p>

<p>So he said good-day, and in three
minutes he had disappeared. The
dwarf too said good-day quite politely
for him, and then he struck the
ground with the point of his lance,
and immediately the earth opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
before him and he marched into the
opening at the head of his troops,
and with their trumpets blowing and
banners waving they disappeared, and
the Princess never saw them nor their
master again—and to tell the truth she
was not very sorry. But the Prince
and Princess marched back to the
town at the head of the army, and
there Lord Licec met them and congratulated
the Princess on her success,
and the people shouted for joy, and
the bells pealed gladly.</p>

<p>So they marched through the town to
the principal city, from which you may
remember she had set out on the day
before. And there they were received
with even greater joy, and for six
days there was feasting and rejoicing
throughout the whole land, but on
the seventh day, after the Princess had
rewarded the knights who had fought
the best, the army dispersed, and the
town quieted down, and everything
went on just as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the Prince of India remained
of all the knights who had fought.
He said he was not well, and wanted
a rest before he set out for India, which
was a long way off. So he stopped
and rested, and the winter changed to
summer, and the summer to autumn,
and he was still there, and he did not
seem as if he were likely to go either.
The time slipped away quietly enough,
and no more was heard of Merrymineral—not
even a word. One day
when the Lords of the Council had
finished sitting for the day, and were
departing, Lord Licec remained, as he
always did when he had anything
private to say to the Princess. So
she said:</p>

<p>‘Well, my lord, what is it that you
wish to tell to me to-day?’</p>

<p>‘I had come, your Majesty, to make
a suggestion to you that it would be
greatly to the good of the nation if
your Majesty would condescend to
think about marrying some one.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess was so startled that
she quite jumped:</p>

<p>‘Marry any one! good gracious me,
whom am I to marry? I don’t know
any one that I like at all.’</p>

<p>Lord Licec stroked his chin:</p>

<p>‘That is rather a drawback,’ he
said; ‘but I had thought that perhaps
the Prince of India might——’</p>

<p>But the Princess interrupted him:</p>

<p>‘Oh, he would never do; besides he
would have to ask me, and he won’t
do that.’</p>

<p>But it might have been noticed that
she blushed just a little as she said it,
so that perhaps she was not quite
sincere in what she said. Lord
Licec did not notice that, so he
said:</p>

<p>‘Well, if he won’t suit, the only
thing to do is to have a tournament,
and then you must marry the winner.’</p>

<p>But she did not seem to like the
idea at all.</p>

<p>‘Suppose the winner should turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
out a hunchback, or a cripple, or a
very hideous man,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty might arrange it so
that the candidates should only be
allowed to tilt if they were sufficiently
handsome.’</p>

<p>She agreed to the suggestion.</p>

<p>‘I suppose it is the only thing to
do,’ she said; and it was arranged
that in four weeks’ time a grand
tournament was to take place for the
hand of the Princess Ismara, and that
all the handsome knights in the world
could come if they liked.</p>

<p>As to the Owl, when he was asked
if he liked the arrangement, he gravely
nodded his head; so the Princess felt
quite safe in her choice, and the
Prince of India felt contented also, for
he knew he had a very good chance
of winning, unless some knight of
whom he had never heard should
suddenly turn up. He spent the
time in between in practising for the
tournament, and he ordered a new set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of armour to be sent to him from
India in time.</p>

<p>So every one seemed pleased with
the arrangement, except, perhaps, the
ugly knights, but they kept quiet
about it.</p>

<p>The month went away quietly,
except that the town was gradually
filling with knights, who were coming
to take part in the contest. The lists
were erected on a plain just outside the
town-walls, and on the day before the
tournament the free seats were already
filled with people, who had come there
determined to get places even if they
had to wait all day long and had to
sleep there all night. As you may
imagine, the Princess did not get
much sleep that night, for she was
naturally in a great fever of excitement
thinking about who the knight
would be. One thing she was sure
about, and that was, that if she did
not like him she would not have
anything to do with him, even if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
had to forfeit her kingdom. However
that might be, she did not sleep that
night, and on the morrow she felt
quite tired. She dressed herself in
her most splendid robes, and drove
to the lists in a little basket-work
pony carriage drawn by eight little
mouse-coloured ponies. It was a
beautiful day, and the road to the
lists was covered with people who
were going to look on, or to take part
in the tournament, and as she went by
they drew up their horses to bow to
her, for she had specially forbidden
them to cheer—she said it made
her head ache. So she drove down
the hard, white road bowing and
smiling to the people, and they smiled
and looked glad too, for they were
very fond of their Princess.</p>

<p>After she had gone along thus for
about five minutes she overtook the
Prince of India, who was going the
same way on his famous horse. The
Prince did not seem to see her—in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he was engaged in looking very hard
at his spur on the other side.</p>

<p>But the Princess did not mean to
pass him like that, so she said cheerfully:</p>

<p>‘Good morning, Prince.’</p>

<p>He looked up quite astonished:</p>

<p>‘Good morning, your Majesty!’ he
said, and he took off his cap and
bowed low in his saddle, for you see
he had not got his armour on—he had
sent it on with his page.</p>

<p>The Princess did not know exactly
what to say next, so for a moment they
were silent, and the Prince trotted
quietly by her side. At last she
said:</p>

<p>‘Are you, too, going to look on at
the tournament?’</p>

<p>The Prince answered:</p>

<p>‘I had purposed taking part in it—that,
ahem!—is if your Majesty thinks
I am sufficiently handsome, and if you
have no other objection.’</p>

<p>The Princess answered quickly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, no objection at all. I should
like it very much—that is, if you are
content to run the risk of your life for
such a small prize.’</p>

<p>But the Prince only answered:</p>

<p>‘Oh, your Majesty!’ and her Majesty
flushed a little at his reply.</p>

<p>So they went on again in silence, and
the road began to get fuller and fuller
of people, and the Princess had her
time so taken up by managing her
ponies—for she was driving herself, you
know—that she could not say much.</p>

<p>However, just as they reached the
entry she said:</p>

<p>‘By the bye, what seat have you got?’</p>

<p>‘I believe they’ve given me a seat
over on the south side,’ he answered.</p>

<p>‘Dear me, how careless of them. Why,
you’ll have the sun in your face all the
time you’re not tilting, and it will give
you such a headache. You’d better
come into the Royal Box—they’ve got
an awning over that, and you’ll be able
to see much better. Do come.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Prince gave his horse to his
page and went with the Princess and
the Owl—for you must remember that
the Owl was always perched on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>The lists were very gay with horses,
and knights, and heralds, and many
and great were the knights that intended
to tilt. They had come from
the uttermost parts of the world—from
Kensington, from Nubia, from—well,
from everywhere, for you see they did
not get the chance of fighting for a
princess every day. So you may
imagine how many suitors there were.
Nearly a thousand came, but a good
many of them were not considered
handsome enough, so they either went
away in a tiff or else they stayed to
look on. Still it would take a good
three days before the last man had
tilted.</p>

<p>The entrance of the Princess was
the signal for the music to begin, and
the procession of knights filed past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
each one bowing to the Princess and
making his horse perform feats of skill.
And then the tournament began and
the knights charged each other, each
in their turn. The way they managed
it was for each knight to throw lots for
the order of their fighting, and then
they were to be divided into two bodies—the
challengers and those to be
challenged; and as it came to the turn
of each challenger, he rode out and
touched the shield of the knight on the
other side with whom he wished to fight,
and then the victors were to fight it
out among themselves until they were
all finished except one.</p>

<p>The Prince of India happened to be
one of the challengers, and his turn
did not come until the afternoon. So
during the morning he sat in the Royal
Box talking to the Princess or to the
lords and maids in waiting.</p>

<p>But the Princess did not seem to
enjoy the gentle and joyous passages
of arms at all, for you see she was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
soft-hearted, and did not like to see the
knights knocked off their horses so
very roughly. So, on the whole, she
was not nearly so gay as the Prince,
and indeed, she seemed very unhappy
when he went to put on his panoply as
his turn came near.</p>

<p>However, he soon afterwards came
into the lists dressed in his full armour,
and you may be sure he looked very
splendid, mounted on his black horse—for
his armour was entirely of silver,
and his shield shone so brightly that it
hurt one’s eyes to look at it, and his
long plumes floated in the wind a great
many yards behind him.</p>

<p>The spectators cheered him very
much as he caracoled from one end of
the lists to the other, and the Princess
quite brightened up as she saw him.</p>

<p>‘I wonder whose shield he’s going
to touch?’ she said to herself; and
when she saw who it was she said:</p>

<p>‘Good gracious me! he’s challenged
the Knight of Sarragos; why, he’s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
greatest knight in the world. Oh
dear, I’m sure the Prince will be
beaten.’</p>

<p>However, the knights were now
going each to his own station at
different ends of the lists. The horses
seemed quite as excited as the knights,
and they champed their bits and
foamed and pawed up the ground,
while the heralds read the challenge
from the Prince of India to the Knight
of Sarragos.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the Princess was
right about the strength of the Knight,
for he was of enormous size, and he
looked a veritable pillar of steel as he
sat on his horse listening to the challenge.
However, the trumpets for the charge
sounded, and away went the knights
straight towards each other like arrows,
each one looking along his spear to see
that it was aimed truly for his adversary—covering
himself well with his shield.
They went so fast that they could
hardly be seen, and the crash when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
they met was louder than the loudest
peal of thunder you ever heard.</p>

<p>The Princess shut her eyes at the
sound. But she could not keep them
shut, for the people were cheering very
loudly. So she opened them reluctantly,
and she seemed quite glad to see that
the Knight of Sarragos had been thrown
from his horse by the shock and was
rolling in the dust. It was rather odd
that she should be pleased at this,
because as a rule she was sorry for the
conquered knight; for myself I rather
think she had wanted the Prince to
win all along. Anyhow she congratulated
him warmly on his success
when he came back to his seat, and
for the rest of the day she did not
seem much interested in the tilting
although some of it was very good,
too.</p>

<p>So the first two days passed away
and nothing particular happened. The
Prince of India took his turn with the
rest, till at last the third day came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
there were only ten knights left. These,
too, the Prince overcame, and it seemed
as if all was over and he had gained the
prize; but while the heralds were still
calling for any one to come and defeat
the Prince, and while every one was
holding their breath in expectation, a
loud blast from a trumpet sounded
through the air, and at the other end
of the lists a knight appeared. He
was a very tall and splendid-looking
knight—for his armour was of gold, and
the crest on his helmet-top was a
dragon carved out of a rose-red ruby of
enormous size; and the point of his
lance was made of one diamond, that
sparkled in the sun a great deal more
brightly than any dewdrop on a spring
morning. And as to handsome, why
he was a perfect blaze of handsomeness,
so that there could be no objection
to him. The only thing was, no one
knew who he was, or where he came
from.</p>

<p>So the Princess beckoned him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
her, and he came and bowed low in
his saddle.</p>

<p>‘Who are you, Sir Knight?’ she
asked; ‘and where do you come
from?’</p>

<p>‘I am the Knight of London, your
Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘London, London; where’s that?—I’ve
never heard of it.’</p>

<p>‘London is the capital city of
England.’</p>

<p>‘But where <i>is</i> England?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘I had thought that every one had
heard of England,’ he said. ‘However,
as no report of England has ever
reached your ears, I will tell your
Majesty. The British Islands, of
which England is one, are a set
of small islands off the west coast of
Europe. They are composed of
England, Scot——’</p>

<p>But here the Princess interrupted
him.</p>

<p>‘I thank you, Sir Knight, for your
information, but just now the tournament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
is waiting for you, and I am not
very fond of geography lessons.’</p>

<p>The Knight bowed again, and retired
to take up his place in the lists.</p>

<p>‘How very handsome he is!’ said the
Princess to one of her maids in waiting.</p>

<p>And the lady answered:</p>

<p>‘Oh, quite too handsome!’</p>

<p>However, by this time both the
knights were in their places, and the
Princess nodded to the heralds to give
the signal.</p>

<p>‘<i>Laissez aller</i>,’ they cried, which is
the French for ‘Go.’</p>

<p>And they did go with a vengeance—they
went so fast that they looked all
blurred together like streaks of lightning.
And when they met, it was louder
than thunder, louder than the shock of
avalanches, louder than—well, louder
than everything you ever heard, except
perhaps when some one lets the tea-tray
fall down the kitchen stairs.</p>

<p>And when the dust cleared up, the
poor Knight of India was rolling on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ground in a heap, composed of himself
and his horse. But the Princess did
not seem very sorry for him—so wags
the world.</p>

<p>The Knight of London, however, was
seated in his saddle as firmly as if he
were part of it; and as there seemed
nothing else to do, he commanded his
heralds to challenge any one who
should wish to dispute his right to
the victory. But no one came out,
for either there was no one else left, or
else the knights were afraid to enter the
lists against one who had overthrown
so easily so doughty a knight as the
Prince of India. However that might
be, no one turned up, so the Knight
of London was declared the victor.
The shout that was raised at this
declaration was not very tremendous,
for most of the people liked the Prince
of India, whereas they did not care
much for the new-comer. But he did
not seem to mind it much, and he
went smilingly to the Princess. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
came before the royal presence he
made his horse kneel, and advance
kneeling, till he was quite close.</p>

<p>Then he said:</p>

<p>‘As no one appears to dispute my
right I believe I am the victor, and
in virtue of that right I claim your
Majesty’s hand.’</p>

<p>But the Princess laughed.</p>

<p>‘Oh, we’ll see about that to-morrow;
there’ll be plenty of time then. Meanwhile,
this evening we are going to
give a ball at the palace, to which all
who have taken part in the tournament
are invited. Of course you’ll come,
won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I will, at your invitation,
your Majesty, but——’</p>

<p>What he was going to say was
drowned in an immoderate fit of
laughter, which came from the Prince
of India.</p>

<p>‘Ha! ha! ha!’ he laughed. ‘Can’t
you see who it is you’re talking to?’
he continued, talking to the Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess drew herself up.</p>

<p>‘I believe I am talking to the
Knight of London,’ she said severely.</p>

<p>‘The Knight of London! why he’s
no more the Knight of London than
I am. Why, your Majesty must be
blind or mad, or both, not to see who
he is. Blind’s not enough to express
it. You——’</p>

<p>But he got no farther, for the
Princess called for the police to arrest
him, but before they could get at him
he had fainted; for the spear of the
Knight of London had gone right
through his side. So the Princess
told the police to lift him up gently
and to carry him to his house in the
town.</p>

<p>But the Knight of London frowned:</p>

<p>‘If I were you, your Majesty, I
should order them to cut his head off
on the first opportunity. To call you
mad and blind—why I’ve never heard
of such a thing.’</p>

<p>But the Princess said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That would never do. Why, he is an
independent prince, and if I hurt him
it would bring on a war with India,
and goodness knows what else. However,
I’ll have him turned out of the
kingdom as soon as he is well enough
to go. However, I am going back now.
Mind and be in time this evening.’</p>

<p>So he went to doff his armour, and
she drove home once more—this time
without the poor Prince, who was being
carried behind in an ambulance waggon.
The rest of the day passed off somehow,
and the night came at last, as nights are
in the habit of doing, and with the night
came knights—no longer dressed in
steel armour, but gorgeous in velvet
and silk and evening dress. But, however
gorgeous and fine they might be,
the Knight of London outstripped
them all, in dress, manners, looks, and
everything else, and the Princess said
he had the best step of any one she
had ever known—and she ought to
know, for she danced with him a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
many times. In fact, by the end of
the ball she had forgotten all about
the poor Prince, for the Knight of
London was a most enchanting person—although
one thing did seem strange,
and that was, that the Knight seemed
positively afraid of the Owl; and at
supper-time he actually refused to sit
on the right hand of the Princess
because the Owl was sitting on her
right shoulder.</p>

<p>But the Owl took no notice of him
at all, and never even looked at him,
so she thought it was only a rather
foolish prejudice on his part. However,
the ball came to an end at last,
and the Princess went to bed and
dreamt pleasantly of some one, but
it was not the Prince this time.</p>

<p>And the Prince lay tossing on his
bed only half dreaming, and not
pleasantly, of some one, and it <i>was</i>
the Princess. As for the Knight of
London, nobody knows what he
dreamt about; and, to tell the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
nobody cared. But the Owl sat at
the head of the Princess’s bed, and
slept calmly,—he did not dream;
owls are not in the habit of dreaming—they
are a good deal wiser.</p>

<p>When the next morning came, the
Knight of London came with it, and
he wanted to know when the Princess
would marry him; but the Princess
put him off—for somehow, although
she liked him very much, she did
not altogether relish the idea of
marrying so soon. So she told him
that he must wait until the Lords of
the Council had given their consent,
and they were not going to meet till
the next day, so he would have to
wait till then. But the Knight did
not like this at all.</p>

<p>‘At all events, my dear Princess,’ he
said, ‘you might promise to marry
me, for, after all, I did win the tournament,
you see, and so——’</p>

<p>But the Princess put her hand to
her chin and rubbed it softly as if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
were thinking very deeply—and no
doubt she was—and shook her head
emphatically.</p>

<p>‘No; I can’t promise until the
Council have given their consent, for
you see that would be unconstitutional,
and I can’t be that even for you.’</p>

<p>The Knight seemed quite angry.</p>

<p>‘Bother the unconstitutionality,’ he
said; ‘what does the stupid old Council
want to blunder into such matters?’</p>

<p>But the Princess stopped him:</p>

<p>‘Oh, you mustn’t say that—please
don’t say that,’ she said; ‘it’s not a
stupid old Council, it’s a very nice old
Council, and it’s much nicer than you are.
When you get angry like that you’re
not at all nice—so just be quiet; now
do.’</p>

<p>And he had to be quiet, for he was
afraid of making her really angry.</p>

<p>She too was afraid she had hurt
his feelings by telling him to be quiet.
So she asked him to join the hunt that
was preparing outside, and he of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
accepted her invitation, for you see
he was only too glad to make it up.
They rode out of the town, and soon
a deer was started, and the chase swept
through the tall trees after it over the
thick carpet of fallen leaves and
between the trunks of the beech-trees.
As a rule the Princess’s horse was
swifter than any of the deer they
started, but this one seemed an exception
to the rule, for it went on at just
the rate she did, keeping always
at the same speed whether she pulled
her horse in or let it go at the
top of its speed. The Princess was
quite annoyed at this. Gradually she
passed all the knights and huntsmen
who were labouring forward at full
gallop, and then she came up with the
hoarse-tongued hounds, who were
running steadily along with their noses
close to the ground. And then she
passed them too, and their deep
mouthing sounded behind, and gradually
the shouts of the huntsmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the cries of the dogs and all the sounds
of the chase died away behind, and
still the deer kept steadily forward.
Just at this time she noticed the heavy
gallop of a horse behind her, and
looking round she saw the Knight of
London cantering easily behind. So
she slackened her speed a little to let
him come up, and then she stopped to
let the rest of the chase come up with
her; and when she stopped the deer
stopped too, and nibbled quietly at a
flower that was growing at the foot of
a tree.</p>

<p>By this time the Knight had come
up with her, and she said:</p>

<p>‘So here you are. What an annoying
thing that deer is—I can’t catch it up,
do whatever I may, and my horse used
to be thought the fastest in the world,
except one,’ she added, after a
moment.</p>

<p>‘That is strange,’ said the Knight.
‘I used always to think mine the
fastest in the world, and indeed, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Majesty, I think it is quite as fast as
yours.’</p>

<p>‘I do believe it is,’ she said. ‘It’s
most annoying; every second person I
see now has a horse as fast as mine.
However, we’ll try a race as soon as
the rest have caught us up.’</p>

<p>Just at that moment a hound’s bay
came from close behind them, and the
deer started off again.</p>

<p>‘There it goes,’ said the Princess;
and again she started off, and the
Knight kept close beside her. They
went faster than ever, and she could
hardly breathe because of the wind,
but the Knight kept steadily by her
side, and would not be out-distanced.
Just at this moment she happened to
look upwards, and there was the Owl
sailing quietly along just over her
head, flapping his wings lazily as if
there were no need for exertion,
although they were going at such a rate
that the Princess could hardly keep her
eyes open—just as when you put your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
head out of the window of a railway
train that is going pretty fast—a thing,
by the bye, that it is to be hoped you
never do, or you might get your nose
chopped off against a post. When she
looked down from the Owl, to her
surprise the deer had vanished altogether,
and although she rubbed her
eyes she could not see it anywhere;
and although they galloped still farther
on, no deer made its appearance, and
the forest had become dark and thick
and she had never been there before.
So she drew her horse in so suddenly
that its hoofs threw up the copper-coloured
beech-leaves in showers, and
the Knight shot some distance in
advance. However, he turned and
came back. So the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘What are we to do now?’</p>

<p>‘Go back, I suppose,’ he answered.</p>

<p>‘But I don’t know the way,’ she
said, ‘and we are near the country of
the Magi, and they’re the most frightful
creatures, who would tear us up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
eat us if they knew where to find
us.’</p>

<p>The Knight smiled:</p>

<p>‘I could save you from them,’ he
said.</p>

<p>But the Princess said reflectively:</p>

<p>‘I don’t know so much about that,
for you see they’re very strong—and
how dark it’s getting; it must be past
five, and it will soon be night.’</p>

<p>I daresay if she had been alone she
would have had a good cry, but that
wouldn’t do before strangers.</p>

<p>It was still getting darker and she
began to feel very uncomfortable, for
the howl of a wolf came down on the
breeze, and a squirrel that had been
searching for nuts darted home to its
hole, scuttling along as fast as it could.</p>

<p>So she said:</p>

<p>‘Come, let us be quick and get away.’</p>

<p>‘Promise to marry me first.’</p>

<p>But she only said:</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’ll see about that when we’re
safe—so do come.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>What the Knight would have
answered was never known, for just
then the Owl, who was seated on her
shoulder, gave a mournful ‘Tu-whoo,’
at which the horse of the Knight jumped
back nearly ten feet and almost threw
him with the unexpected shock. But
before she could do anything a hunter
burst from the bushes near at hand
and said:</p>

<p>‘Hurry, Princess, hurry; the Magi
have heard of your whereabouts, and
they are coming at full speed here.
Come, be quick.’</p>

<p>But the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘But what will you do, old man? for
you have no horse.’</p>

<p>But he smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>‘Horse! I don’t want a horse—why,
I can run as well as any deer. Come,
come.’</p>

<p>And he caught the bridle of her
horse and away they went, and for the
moment she forgot all about the Knight,
for from behind came the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
crashing branches, and she knew that
the Magi were following them. But
the old hunter ran in front of the
horse, tugging at the bridle-rein, and
shouting to her to go faster, so she
leant forward and whispered in her
horse’s ear, and it stretched forward
with such speed that it outsped the
wind. Gradually the sounds behind
began to get less and less, and the
wood began to get lighter, and at
last they jumped a little brook, and
were at the end of the forest in a
smooth meadow. Here the old man
stopped.</p>

<p>‘You are safe now,’ he said. And
she drew a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>‘At last!’ she said; ‘but how can I
reward you, my preserver? Would you
like a lock of my hair, or a purse full
of gold, or a——? well that wouldn’t
do—you see I can’t well offer to marry
you, though that’s what princesses
generally do to their preservers.
You’d better choose something for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
yourself. I will grant it, whatever
it is.’</p>

<p>But the old man shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I want no reward, your Majesty; I
only did my duty. I couldn’t have
done less. See, here come some of
the hunters whom you left behind.’</p>

<p>And just then several of them came
up, and when they saw her they
shouted and blew their horns to let
the others know that the Princess was
found. But the huntsman said:</p>

<p>‘Good-day, your Majesty. I must
go.’</p>

<p>‘But you haven’t got your reward
yet.’</p>

<p>But he shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I want no reward,’ he said; and
before the Princess could say any
more he stepped into the forest and
was seen no more; so she turned her
horse towards the town.</p>

<p>On her way she met the head
huntsman, so she drew rein and
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why did you not follow on the
scent of the deer?’</p>

<p>‘It lay so thinly, your Majesty, that
the dogs could not follow, and they
soon gave in.’</p>

<p>‘But you should have followed me,
at any rate.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, your Majesty, we might as
well have tried to prove the moon
was made of green cheese. Besides,
your Majesty had one cavalier; and
sometimes two’s company and three’s
none.’</p>

<p>Just at this moment the Princess
remembered the Knight.</p>

<p>‘Good gracious!’ she said, ‘what
has become of the Knight—have none
of you seen him?’</p>

<p>But none of them had, and although
the question went far and wide no
news came of him, nor could he be
seen anywhere.</p>

<p>‘He must have been caught by the
Magi—if so, he will have been devoured
to a certainty! Poor Knight!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief huntsman seemed excited:</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty has not been near
the country of the Magi surely?’ he
said.</p>

<p>‘I was almost too near, and the
poor Knight has probably been torn to
pieces in trying to drive them back.’</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty should be thankful
that knights are so faithful,’ said the
chief huntsman; ‘but perhaps, after
all, he has escaped by a different
path.’</p>

<p>But the Princess sighed:</p>

<p>‘I am afraid not,’ she said.</p>

<p>However, she rode on to the
town to consult Lord Licec as to what
had better be done. But when she
got there she found that he was out of
town and would not be back till next
morning. So the poor Princess had
to go back home and wait—but she
looked so pale that her ladies-in-waiting
insisted on sending for the doctor.
He came in a hurry, and asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
her of course what was the matter, and
when she told him he shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid he’s got rather a poor
chance, for these Magi haven’t had
a good meal of one of your Majesty’s
subjects for nearly three weeks, and
they were uncommonly hungry. But
if your Majesty will allow me to feel
your pulse, I——’</p>

<p>So she gave him her hand, and he
took out his watch and began to
count. ‘One, two, three, four’; but
just then he looked up and saw the
Owl sitting on the Princess’s shoulder,
and his hand trembled so much that
he dropped his watch, and it smashed
to atoms on the floor.</p>

<p>‘Oh dear, there goes ten and sixpence,’
he groaned; ‘and I shan’t be
able to get another for ever so long.
D’you know, your Majesty, I think you
are somewhat feverish; and you had
better go to bed. And meanwhile,
the Owl is too exciting for you; if
you could let it be put in a cellar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
let it have nothing to eat for, say,
three weeks, perhaps it might not be
so fiery after that.’</p>

<p>The Princess smiled:</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you would like to take
him there yourself,’ she said.</p>

<p>But the doctor said:</p>

<p>‘Good gracious! no. I think he’s
perfectly capable of taking himself
without any assistance. D’you know,
your Majesty, I’ve got a very pressing
case outside; and if you will excuse me
I will retire.’</p>

<p>And he retired so quickly that he
left his umbrella behind him—for you
see he was very frightened of the Owl.</p>

<p>Acting on his advice the Princess
went to bed, and dismissed her ladies-in-waiting
and told them not to come
to the room again until she called for
them.</p>

<p>And then she lay with her hand
under her head thinking of nothing in
particular, and the Owl sat on the top
of the canopy over her bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly she heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>‘I wish I knew what had become
of him,’ she thought to herself.</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t like it if you did
know,’ said a strange cracked voice
that seemed to come from nowhere in
particular. She started up and looked
all round the room, but there was no
one to be seen; so she thought it
was all imagination, and lay down
again. And again she thought to
herself, ‘How I should like to be with
him.’</p>

<p>‘No, you wouldn’t,’ said the voice.</p>

<p>This time she was sure it came
from the Owl, so she asked quite softly,
‘Did you say that, cherished Owl?’</p>

<p>And the Owl answered:</p>

<p>‘I did.’</p>

<p>‘But I thought you could not speak,
dear Owl.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, I can sometimes—when
it’s necessary.’</p>

<p>‘But how did you know what I was
thinking?—for I did not speak aloud.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Ah! you see, Princess, I can’t tell
you that—it’s quite enough for you
that I can tell.’</p>

<p>‘But why do you say I should not
like to see him?’</p>

<p>‘Because you wouldn’t.’</p>

<p>‘Why? Is he all torn to pieces by
the Magi?’</p>

<p>‘Torn to pieces!—not he,’ laughed
the Owl.</p>

<p>‘Oh! that is good news,’ said she
quite joyfully. ‘Oh! do take me to
him, dear Owl.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, Princess. But I warn
you, you won’t be pleased with what
you see.’ But the Princess was quite
confident.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, I shall, dear Owl—when
shall we go?’</p>

<p>‘At once, if you like—the sooner
the better.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! you dear Owl. I’ll go and
get dressed at once.’</p>

<p>So she ran into her dressing-room
and dressed herself in no time, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
bothering to call up any of her ladies-in-waiting
about it. Then she went
back to the room where the Owl was
waiting for her.</p>

<p>He was sitting on the floor near
the fire, blinking quietly at the coals,
and he did not at first notice her
entry, so she said:</p>

<p>‘Well, good Owl, shall I send for
the horse?’</p>

<p>‘What for?’ asked the Owl.</p>

<p>‘To ride on, I suppose!’ she
answered.</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s it, is it? That would
never do. Just get on my back, and
I’ll see if I can’t carry you somewhat
faster than a horse could.’</p>

<p>So she got on his back, although
she was rather afraid she would crush
him altogether. But somehow, when
she sat down, she sank deep into
his warm feathers,—either she had
grown small, or the Owl had grown
very big all of a sudden. Without
the least shock they passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the wall, and out into the clear star-light.</p>

<p>‘Good Owl,’ said the Princess,
‘you won’t let me fall, will you?’ for,
to tell the truth, she felt rather afraid
on the whole; but the Owl answered:</p>

<p>‘No, of course not; you’re quite
safe, only you’d better keep close to
me, for we shall go pretty fast, and
the wind will be sharp enough to cut
your hair off.’</p>

<p>So she sat still, protected against
the wind, and looking at the twinkling
stars—for the Owl flew so high that he
almost rubbed some of them out of
their places.</p>

<p>The wind whistled loud in the
wings of the Owl, but his flight was
so regular that she almost fell asleep,
and was quite happy—for you see
she felt quite safe. Presently the
straight flight of the Owl changed, and
he began to circle round and round,
and then they dropped quickly towards
the earth, and the Owl stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You can get off now,’ he said, and
she stepped off his back.</p>

<p>‘Take care,’ he said next; and she
rubbed her eyes in astonishment, for
she found herself on the top of a
roof.</p>

<p>‘I told you you wouldn’t like it
if you came,’ he said. ‘But you’d
better look down below if you want
to see anything that’s going on,’ and
he gravely seated himself on her
shoulder, for he seemed quite small
again. So the Princess looked down,
and she saw at some distance below
a large fire that was blazing in a sort
of courtyard, and then she saw that
it was the battlements of a castle
on which they were standing. Presently
a horrible-looking old witch
came within the glow of the fire—she
was an awful old creature too, and
she almost made the Princess cry out
from fright. She seated herself near
the fire, and began to beat the ground
angrily with the handle of a broom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that she carried, and every now and
then muttered as she did so:</p>

<p>‘How awfully late he is. Why
don’t he come?’ and various other
complaints of his lateness.</p>

<p>‘But who is he?’ asked the Princess
of the Owl in a whisper.</p>

<p>‘Wait, and you’ll see,’ said the
Owl.</p>

<p>Just then something peculiar
happened down below—a couple of
men appeared suddenly. They did
not seem to come from anywhere in
particular, but they were there all the
same. The Princess almost screamed
with astonishment, but she checked
herself in time by stuffing a pocket-handkerchief
into her mouth, for one
of the men whom she saw was the
Knight of London, and the other was
Magog the King of the Magi; and
the Knight of London did not seem
to be on bad terms with the King of
the Magi.</p>

<p>‘You’ve come at last,’ growled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
old woman, in a voice something
between the squeaking of a slate-pencil
on a slate and the growling of
a bear with a sore head.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t come any sooner,
mother,’ said the Knight of London
soothingly; ‘you see I had to wait for
her to promise to marry me.’</p>

<p>‘Well, has she promised?’ said the
witch.</p>

<p>‘Not yet.’</p>

<p>‘Then why on earth not?’</p>

<p>‘She said she had to wait for the
consent of the Council.’</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you eat her?’ said
Magog sleepily; and then, without
waiting for an answer, he curled himself
up close to the fire and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>But the old witch went on:</p>

<p>‘Well, and what are your plans
now?’</p>

<p>‘I’m going back to-morrow morning,
and I’m going to take old Magog and
pretend that he’s my prisoner of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and then the stupid old Council will
say I’ve done a service to the State,
and they will give me the hand of the
Princess for my pains.’</p>

<p>‘But supposing they don’t?’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall cut them all to pieces,
and kill the Princess, and make myself
king by force—for you see nothing can
cut through my armour, except one
thing.’</p>

<p>‘And what’s that?’ asked the
witch.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t mind telling you,
mother, because you won’t go and tell
any one—it’s <i>Paper</i>!’</p>

<p>‘That’s a funny sort of thing to cut
through armour.’</p>

<p>‘It may be funny,’ answered the
Knight, ‘but it’s true all the same, and
if the Prince of India had found it out
I should not be where I am now; only
he didn’t, you see.’</p>

<p>‘So much the worse for him,’ said
the witch; ‘but is there nothing at all
but paper that can cut through it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, there is one thing that can—the
beak of the Owl, to wit.’</p>

<p>‘Tu—whoo!’ suddenly cried the
Owl.</p>

<p>The effect of this sudden cry was
tremendous. The Knight clung to his
mother, and cried out in a piteous
voice:</p>

<p>‘Oh, mother! mother! it’s the Owl;
save me!’</p>

<p>‘How on earth can I save you if
you hang on me like this?’ said his
mother. ‘Just throw some more wood
on, so that we can see this Owl, and
I’ll fling my broom at it, and see if
that won’t bring it down.’</p>

<p>But the Princess leant her head to
the Owl, and said:</p>

<p>‘Dear Owl, let’s go. I’ve seen
quite enough.’</p>

<p>And the Owl seemed to think the
same, for he said:</p>

<p>‘All right. Just get on my back
again, and we’ll go.’</p>

<p>So she did as she was told, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sooner had she got on his back than
she fell asleep, and remembered no
more until she found herself lying on
her bed with the early morning sun
shining through the lattice.</p>

<p>She rubbed her eyes in astonishment,
and it seemed as if it had been
all a dream. But it all was so clear
on her mind, and besides she had on
her riding-clothes just as she had put
them on to go with the Owl.</p>

<p>To make herself feel more sure she
said to the Owl:</p>

<p>‘Good Owl, was it a dream?’</p>

<p>And the Owl shook his head, but
although she asked him several times
to speak she could not get the least
word out of him, although he always
shook his head if she asked him if it
was a dream.</p>

<p>Just then a tremendous noise in
the street made her run to the window,
and there she saw the Knight of
London coming up to the door,
dragging the King of the Magi behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
him in chains, and the people of the
town were following him in an excited
crowd, which caused all the noise, for
they were naturally very glad to see
their old enemy in chains.</p>

<p>The Knight rode straight up to the
palace door, and when he saw the
Princess at the window he smiled and
said:</p>

<p>‘Good morning, your Majesty—you
see I am returned.’</p>

<p>And the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘Good morning,’ as if she were
very glad to see him, for she had not
yet quite made up her mind about
what she was going to do—for of
course she could not marry him after
what she had seen the night before.
So she drew back from the window to
think about it—for it would never do
to try to get rid of him by force. At
last she hit upon a plan—she had to
think of it herself—for the Owl would
tell her nothing.</p>

<p>She went to the door of her room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
but there were no guards at the door—they
had run down to see what the
shouting was about. But just then
the doctor came up the stairs:</p>

<p>‘Good morning, your Majesty,’ he
said; ‘have you had a good night?’</p>

<p>‘A very good night, thank you,
doctor. But that doesn’t matter just
now. I want the Prince of India.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon,’ said the doctor.</p>

<p>‘I say I want the Prince of India.’</p>

<p>‘The <i>who</i>?’ said the astonished
doctor.</p>

<p>‘The Prince of India.’</p>

<p>‘Then I am afraid he can’t come.
But if the Knight of London would
do——’</p>

<p>‘But he won’t! I want the Prince
of India at once.’</p>

<p>‘I fear your Majesty can’t have him
at once. You <i>wouldn’t</i> have him once,
you know.’</p>

<p>‘But why not?’</p>

<p>‘Because at the present moment he
isn’t well enough to move.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, good gracious!—but why is
that?’</p>

<p>‘Well, your Majesty, if you’d been
thrown from your horse with great
violence, and had half a foot of spear
stuck into you, besides being mortified
at your overthrow, perhaps you would
be rather unwell.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, poor fellow, I didn’t know he
was so bad as that. I’ll go and see
him at once.’</p>

<p>‘I think your Majesty had better not.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Because it might excite him too
much, and besides, what would the
Knight of London——’</p>

<p>But the Princess drew herself up
and said:</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, but I must ask
you not to mention that gentleman’s
name, if you please.’</p>

<p>‘Whe—ew,’ ejaculated the doctor;
‘what’s in the wind now?’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon?’ said the
Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I—I only said—it’s an east wind
now, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>Just then a page came running up,
and said that the Knight of London
wished to speak to the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Tell him that I am not quite well
enough to see him now, but I will send
a message to him, if he will stop
a moment. And on your way just
ask Lord Licec to come to me,
please.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, your Majesty,’ said the page,
and he disappeared.</p>

<p>In a moment Lord Licec came.</p>

<p>‘You sent for me, your Majesty, I
believe?’</p>

<p>‘I did, my lord. It was about this
Knight of London. I have discovered
that he is not what he pretends to be
at all, for he is in league with the
Magi; and this Magog whom he
pretends is his prisoner is really
nothing of the sort. He is one of
his allies, and they are going to break
out and kill me, and every one else,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and make themselves masters of everything.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my wig!’ suddenly said the
doctor, ‘I hope your Majesty won’t
let them; if you intend to I shall
depart without delay, for I don’t want
to be eaten by this Magog.’</p>

<p>‘That’s just what I wanted to
prevent by begging the Prince of
India to help us; only you said that
I mayn’t see him, doctor.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! on the contrary, your Majesty,
it would be the best thing in the world—we’ll
go at once.’</p>

<p>‘Wait a moment,’ said the Princess,
and turning to Lord Licec she went on:</p>

<p>‘Now I want you to tell him that
the Lords of the Council say that the
last tournament was unfair, because he
came in fresh at the end. And that
if he wants to—to claim his rights, he
must submit to go through another
tournament. Of course he will—because
he’s quite sure of winning—but
he won’t this time.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Are you quite sure, your Majesty?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! quite. And as all the knights
who tilted last time are still in the
town, let it take place to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘And if you could keep him out of
the way for a few hours—so that he
won’t know what I’m going to do—so
much the better.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll challenge him to a game of
“Beggar-my-Neighbour”—that generally
lasts for a pretty good time.’</p>

<p>‘That will do; the longer the better.
Now I’m ready, doctor, if you’ll conduct
me to the Prince.’</p>

<p>So they went out at a back door
for fear the Knight of London should
see them, and they soon reached the
house of the Prince.</p>

<p>At the door was a servant, and they
asked him where the Prince was.</p>

<p>‘In the garden, your Majesty. I
will go and announce your arrival to
him.’</p>

<p>But the Princess said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh no! never mind—you needn’t
trouble.’</p>

<p>And they went through into the
garden. On the way the Princess
said to the doctor:</p>

<p>‘I thought you said he was not well
enough to get up?’</p>

<p>‘I did, your Majesty, but he insisted
that he must get up, and be off to
India this afternoon, and he was
excessively violent when I told him he
had better not get up—in fact he—he
kicked me downstairs; and if your
Majesty has no present need of me I
will retire, for to tell the truth he
threatened to have me ducked in a
horsepond if I came near him again—and
he meant it too.’</p>

<p>So the Princess gave him leave to
go—in fact she was rather glad he had
gone; and she went on walking down
the path. It was one of those old-fashioned
manor-gardens, full of tall
stiff hollyhocks, and damask roses, and
beds of thyme and mint, over which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the bees were humming so loudly that
they could be heard over the whole
garden. As the Princess could not
see him down one path, she turned
into another alley of stiff holly bushes,
but he was not to be seen down there
either; however, she walked fast to the
end of it—for you see she was rather
impatient. Now it happened that just
as she turned the corner, the Prince
happened to be coming round too, and
the result was that as they were going
rather fast, and the Prince was the
heavier of the two, the Princess was
thrown back with violence against the
hedge, and she couldn’t help exclaiming:</p>

<p>‘Oh!’—for you see he had trodden
on her toe. As for the Prince, he could
scarcely stand—for the shock and the
sight of the Princess together produced
a tremendous effect, as you may
imagine—for she was the last person
he had expected to see.</p>

<p>‘My goodness!’ he said, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he was able to speak. ‘Your Majesty—I
hope I haven’t hurt you—I am really
very sorry. I am very sorry—will you
allow me to help you to a seat?—for
I see I have trodden on your
foot.’</p>

<p>Her Majesty said:</p>

<p>‘Oh no! not at all, thank you.’</p>

<p>But all the same she let him give her
his arm, and help her to a seat. It was
a rustic seat—one of those queer seats
made of branches of trees, and it stood
in an arbour formed of rose-bushes, and
there was plenty of room for two; so
she said:</p>

<p>‘Won’t you sit down, Prince?’</p>

<p>But he answered:</p>

<p>‘I really have not the time, your
Majesty. I was just about to start for
India, and if your Majesty has no
further need of me I will go, and send
an attendant.’</p>

<p>But she did not seem to hear the last
part of his sentence, for she answered:</p>

<p>‘You were going away without saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
good-bye to me. Perhaps, however,
you intended to call as you passed the
palace.’</p>

<p>‘I really had not intended to, your
Majesty, for you seemed to have so
many affairs that I might have interrupted,
that I thought it as well to
go without troubling you.’</p>

<p>‘You shouldn’t have thought that.
You see I have had so many affairs of
State occupying me that I could not
possibly get round to call, and you
didn’t choose to come and see me,
which was rather, I think—however,
that doesn’t matter now. I have come
to ask you to stop a little longer—till
the day after to-morrow, if you won’t
stop after that.’</p>

<p>But the Prince shook his head:</p>

<p>‘I have to go immediately; affairs of
State, you know, demand my presence
in India, and I must go at once, your
Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you really stop a little
Prince?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I really can’t, your Majesty—that
is——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, please do; I’ll tell you something,
if you like. I’ve found out who
the Knight of London is.’</p>

<p>‘And then, your Majesty?’ inquired
the Prince.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what else. I—I
thought that would be enough for you.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand you, your
Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘I mean that when I didn’t know he
was a wizard I thought he was very
enchanting; but when I found out he
was an enchanter, I thought you were
enchanter—I mean more enchanting.’</p>

<p>The Prince was just saying:</p>

<p>‘Oh, your Majesty,’ when a peculiar
noise from the back of the arbour
made them both start, and the Princess
jumped up so violently that the Owl,
who had meanwhile gone to sleep, was
nearly shaken off her shoulder.</p>

<p>‘What was that?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘It sounded like somebody laughing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
or trying to keep from laughing rather.
Just wait a moment, I’ll see who it was.’</p>

<p>And he went round behind the
arbour. He soon returned bringing
the doctor with him, and the doctor
did not seem at all happy either.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said the Princess, ‘I thought
you were going to leave me. How is
it that you came like this behind the
arbour?’</p>

<p>‘I might just as well ask your
Majesty why you came here.’</p>

<p>‘You might, but it would not be
answering my question.’</p>

<p>‘I happened to come round there,
your Majesty, to read a book in the
shade, and I happened to drop off to
sleep, and the noise you heard was my
snoring.’</p>

<p>‘But how did you know we heard a
noise if you were asleep at the time?’</p>

<p>‘I—eh—I don’t exactly know, your
Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘It’s quite clear you were listening.
I’ll excuse you this time, but if I catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
you eavesdropping again I’ll make the
Owl take you up into the sky and drop
you—that may be a drop too much for
you. You can go now, but don’t do so
any more.’</p>

<p>But the Prince had still hold of
him.</p>

<p>‘By the bye,’ he said, ‘there’s a
horsepond near here; I think I’ll just
take you there and throw you in,
as I said I would if I caught you
again.’</p>

<p>But the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘Oh, let him go, Prince,’ and the
doctor hurried off at a great rate.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think he’ll come back again
in a hurry,’ said the Prince; ‘meanwhile,
what about the Knight of London?’</p>

<p>‘I must get rid of him as soon as I
can, and I want you to help me.’</p>

<p>‘I, your Majesty—but how?’</p>

<p>‘The Council have decided that last
tournament was not fair, because the
Knight came in fresh and you were
already tired out, so they have decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to have it over again, and you are requested
to come and fight—for me.’</p>

<p>‘But what is the use of that? he’ll
knock me over just as he did before.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no! he won’t, because I’ve found
out his secret.’ And she told him
about the paper.</p>

<p>At the end the Prince said:</p>

<p>‘Oh! that’s all right then. I’ll be
there, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘But are you strong enough, do you
think?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘And the affairs of State can be put
off till the day after to-morrow. I
promise to let you go as soon as
you have got rid of the Knight for
me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, for the matter of that, there is
no such great hurry. I really needn’t
go for some time.’</p>

<p>‘But you can go whenever you like,
you know.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘But—a—I don’t want you to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
you know. In fact I should like you
to stop, very much.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll stop as long as you like,
your Majesty—for ever, if you like,
your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘I should like it very much, Prince,’
she answered.</p>

<p>I don’t exactly know what happened
after that—perhaps you can guess—but
they do say that the Owl, who
chanced to wake at that moment,
positively blushed; but then people are
fond of exaggerating, and the Owl did
not seem to object, so I suppose it was
all right; and when the Princess went
back to the palace, the Prince was
quite good-tempered again, whereas
before her visit he had been so angry
that all his servants had left in a body—however,
they came back when they
found he was quiet again.</p>

<p>So the Princess was quite happy
once more, as you may imagine, only
there was one nasty thing she had to
do, and that was to send a note to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Knight of London thanking him for
having taken prisoner the King of the
Magi, and hoping that he would be
successful at the tournament on the
next day—for you see she was not well
enough to see him, and he was quite
sure of winning, as he had done before,
so he did not mind it very much.</p>

<p>The next day came, and the Princess
was at the lists as before, and the
crowd was just as great too, only there
were very many less knights to fight,
for the Knight of London was the
challenger, and he—well, they had seen
how he had treated the Prince of India,
and they did not care to be tumbled
over in such a very unceremonious
way. However, two or three of the
bravest in the world came and answered
his challenge, but it was no use; they
might just as well not have tried, for
they were thrown from their horses so
violently that they were most of them
seriously hurt. So it seemed as if he
was going to have it all his own way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
for the Prince had as yet not put in an
appearance, and the spectators began
to call for him—for, as I said before,
they liked the Prince better than the
Knight; although he was so very handsome,
still there was a something about
him that they did not like at all. But
the Knight had overcome all who had
chosen to come against him, and his
trumpets were sounding the challenge
for the last time, and then their echoes
died away and still no answering
trumpet came, and the Princess was
beginning to feel afraid that he had
gone off to India and left her. But
just as the Knight was advancing to
claim his rights, a trumpet blast rang
out brazen and shrill on the still air,
and the Prince of India rode into the
lists. He was still pale from his illness,
but the people cheered him loudly, and
the Princess gave a sigh of relief, and
quite flushed with joy and excitement.</p>

<p>‘He’ll win this time,’ she said to
Lord Licec, who was standing near her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know so much about that,’
he answered, ‘for you see the Knight
of London is in very good form to-day;
and just look at the Prince’s
shield—it’s made of cardboard, I
should think—yes, it is. Ah—I am
afraid his last defeat has rather turned
his head.’</p>

<p>The Princess smiled and nodded.
Lord Licec thought she was nodding
to him, but she wasn’t; both the
smile and the nod were meant for
quite another person.</p>

<p>However, the combatants were
already in their places, so she signed
to the heralds to give the signal.</p>

<p>‘<i>Laissez aller</i>,’ they cried, and once
again the Knight and Prince charged
each other. This time they did not
go so fast, and the spectators could see
what took place. It was soon over.
The spear of each of the combatants
hit exactly the centre of the other’s
shield. But the spear of the Knight
broke as if it had been made of a bulrush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
It was not so with the Prince—for
his spear pierced through and through
the seven-fold shield of the Knight,
and the Knight himself was thrown
right off his horse on to the ground.
He, however, was on his feet in an
instant, and rushed at the Prince, who
leapt off his horse and confronted the
Knight.</p>

<p>The Knight made a pass at the
Prince with his rapier, but the Prince
caught the thrust on his shield, and the
sword came to the same end as the
spear. The Knight had still his
heavy battle-axe, and he lifted it on high
to swing it down on to the head of
his opponent. The Prince made no
movement to defend himself, and the
axe came full on his crest—through the
crest it hit its way, and through the
steel helmet, but when it got past the
steel it hit on a paper helm below,
and the axe shivered at the touch as
if it had been glass. Then the Prince
caught the Knight by the wrist:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Keep still,’ he said, ‘or I run you
to the heart with my paper dagger.’</p>

<p>‘You can’t,’ sneered the Knight.</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Because I’m heartless; so you can’t
hurt my heart.’</p>

<p>The Prince took no notice of what
he said. He had turned to the Princess,
who was clapping her hands for joy—which
was rather an unprincess-like
act; but she couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>‘What shall I do with him?’ he
said.</p>

<p>‘Let him go, I suppose.’</p>

<p>And the Knight was beginning to
walk off as fast as he could. But a
loud and commanding voice came from
behind the Princess, and she looked
behind her suddenly, and she almost
fainted, for a marvellous change had
come over the Owl, and it was still
changing. She rubbed her eyes in
astonishment, and all the people who
could see him did so too, and then a
great shout went up from all of ‘God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
save the King!’ for it was no longer
the Owl they saw—it was the old
King.</p>

<p>‘Stop!’ he cried loudly to the
Knight, who was slinking off—‘you
have not received your reward yet.
Just wait a moment, and to prevent
mistakes just take your ordinary form.’</p>

<p>And again every one present rubbed
their eyes in astonishment—for the
handsome calm face of the Knight
was shrivelling up, and his raven hair
had become an ugly gray, and the
people recognised him too as an old
acquaintance, for he was—who do
you think now? Why, he was Merrymineral—it
seemed as if that day
gave two instances of old friends with
new faces.</p>

<p>Although he didn’t at all seem to
want to stay, he was obliged to stop at
the King’s voice. So he stood in the
middle of the lists looking very uncomfortable—for
every one was looking
at him. The King began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Now let us see how many crimes
you have committed. You have broken
your oath—isn’t that right?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! quite correct, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘And you have rebelled against
my daughter?’</p>

<p>‘Quite correct, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘And you have intended to murder
her?’</p>

<p>‘Just so, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘And you tried to marry her?’</p>

<p>‘I should have been only too
pleased, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘And you don’t repent, do you?’</p>

<p>‘Not at all, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘And the right punishment for each
of your crimes is death?’</p>

<p>‘Just so, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t care to sentence you
to death—it’s not hard enough. I
sentence you to live underground for
ten thousand years.’</p>

<p>‘Ten thousand years, your Majesty!’</p>

<p>‘You can go at once, and if I catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
you above ground—I shouldn’t like to
be you.’</p>

<p>‘No, your Majesty. Good-day.’</p>

<p>And he kissed his hand to the
Princess, and bowed gallantly to the
Prince of India, and then the ground
gave way under him—and he has never
been heard of since. But the King
turned to the Prince of India and
said:</p>

<p>‘You may go now, Prince.’</p>

<p>The Prince looked astonished.</p>

<p>‘I do not quite understand, your
Majesty,’ he said.</p>

<p>The King looked at him and
said:</p>

<p>‘You seem to be uncommonly hard
of understanding, cousin of India. I
said, You can go.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t want to go, your
Majesty,’ the Prince answered, getting
a little red.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t you?’ said the King;
‘from what I heard of a certain
pleasant conversation in a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
summer-house you seemed to have
important affairs of State that demanded
instant attention.’</p>

<p>Here the doctor suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>‘If you will excuse me, your Majesty,
I beg to differ from you when
you refer to that conversation as
pleasant. I myself heard it, or rather
overheard it, and all I can say is I
thought it most unpleasant,—most.
That is, if your Majesty will excuse my
remark.’</p>

<p>‘But I won’t,’ said the King
suddenly. ‘I believe it was you that
suggested I should be confined to a
dark cellar for three weeks without
food—eh!’</p>

<p>But the doctor suddenly remembered
that he had an important case that
demanded instant attention.</p>

<p>The King turned to the Princess
and said:</p>

<p>‘Well—I suppose you can settle it
for yourselves, you two, because I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
going now. I shall come and see you
every seven years. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>And he suddenly turned into the
Brown Owl, and flitted noiselessly off,
before they could say ‘Good-bye,’ or
anything else.</p>

<p>The Prince found that he could
manage to postpone his affairs of State
indefinitely, and in a few days the
Prince and Princess were married and
lived happily ever afterwards.</p>
